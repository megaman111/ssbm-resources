            <h2>General Improvement & Mindset - Zamu</h2>
            
            <h3>Approach to Practice</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Play as if the opponent is the best at their respective character. You don't have to go up from there</li>
                <li>There's merit in beating players the same way versus playing better people. It won't help you beat Zain if you don't treat a worse Marth like Zain</li>
                <li>The goal isn't to beat your opponent but rather is to get better at the matchup</li>
                <li>If you are playing someone over and over and you are beating them the same way, stop playing that interaction - test them somewhere else</li>
                <li>Don't try to work on everything all at once. Pick very specific things, and call yourself out if you see yourself stopping doing that</li>
                <li>Play shorter sessions to be more intentional</li>
                <li>When Zamu plays someone way worse than her she does a lot worse, she'll do way better against the good player because she's not trying to outplay the worse opponent</li>
                <li>If your neutral game is strong it doesn't matter if you open them a lot. If you call them out and they are afraid of you, that's what matters</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Analysis & VOD Review</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you do analysis of your own VODs, look for where you miss kills and where you get killed</li>
                <li>Practice where you miss kills and get killed. These are the fast track options to getting really good</li>
                <li>Make a Google Drive notes for each character - what do I need to work on against this character?</li>
                <li>Be aware of the punish game that is about to occur but don't queue up an action. If you recognize you are late, play an action after</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice Methodology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice specific follow ups → take into account percent, position and DI. Don't get distracted!</li>
                <li>Use custom DI feature in UnclePunch!</li>
                <li>Start more with watching top players</li>
                <li>Make sure your success rate on follow-ups for the meaningful really hard things is high</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Practice Process</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Start off by doing the thing in the easiest way (i.e. waveshine upsmash on Sheik)</li>
                <li>Then move on to doing it from a standing shine</li>
                <li>Then space it farther back</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Practice Drills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice up throw up smash no DI tech chase and make sure to tech chase</li>
                <li>Practice with claw, and without claw for different situations, especially for tech chasing</li>
                <li>Practice waveshine upsmash on Peach, Falcon, Sheik, Marth</li>
                <li>Up throw up air on Puff</li>
                <li>Practice aerial dash back because otherwise aerial shine / aerial isn't on your opponent's mental stack</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Frame Advantage in Neutral - Druggedfox</h2>
            
            <h3>Redefining the Objective</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Rather than viewing the goal as landing a hit, we can view the game in more general terms: the objective is to gain a significant enough frame advantage that the risk/reward in any given situation is skewed in one's favor</li>
                <li>Each game state in Melee can be fully described by variables of space and time: the positions of the two players, and their relative frame advantage</li>
                <li>When thinking about and analyzing matchups, it's important to think about both how interactions play out given various amounts of frame advantage, as well as how effectively each character can influence frame advantage from a neutral state</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Traditional Frame Advantage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Frame advantage traditionally refers to situations where an opponent either gets hit by or blocks an attack</li>
                <li>Example: Fox uptilt on shield is -11 (opponent is actionable for 11 frames before Fox)</li>
                <li>Example: Peach float canceled aerial at lowest height is +4 on shield (she can act 4 frames before opponent)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Frame Advantage in Neutral</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Every movement option chosen when players are "feeling each other out" is just a marginal risk taken to gauge what sort of advantage can be gained</li>
                <li>Each player is trying to reposition relative to their opponent's actions to give them the highest chance of winning an ensuing interaction</li>
                <li>If it seems like the "timing" of the situation will not be advantageous, there is an attempt to disengage and reestablish favorable positioning</li>
                <li>High level players intuitively act based on feel - they get a read on movement patterns and take instinctive actions that allow them to gain advantage while the other person repositions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example: Falcon Nair vs Sheik Ftilt</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sheik's ftilt hits on frame 5, but the part that will realistically hit Falcon isn't until frame 6</li>
                <li>Falcon's nair hits on frame 7, with 4 frames of jump squat = effectively 10 frame startup (hits on frame 11)</li>
                <li>For Falcon to nair without losing to ftilt, he needs to be "+6" in neutral (11-6 = 5 for a trade)</li>
                <li>If Sheik whiffs an ftilt and Falcon isn't in range to whiff punish with grab, he has still gained frame advantage</li>
                <li>If Falcon can position himself close enough to Sheik after she whiffs ftilt and gets there with at least 6 frames to spare, his nair actually beats the ftilt option</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Gaining Frame Advantage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Baiting out an extremely laggy move (like Marth forward smash) gives you significant frame advantage for a guaranteed hit</li>
                <li>If an opponent will try to wavedash forward and that can be predicted, it changes the nature of potential interactions - a wavedash gives ~14 frames of time to do whatever you want</li>
                <li>Nobody sees the game frame by frame, but the concept of "how much time" we have to execute an action in a situation is intuitive to all of us</li>
                <li>This frame advantage can be achieved through many means, and how much advantage you have determines whether it's a good idea to challenge the opponent in any given situation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Think about the game in terms of space and time: the positions of the two players and their relative frame advantage</li>
                <li>The specifics vary greatly from matchup to matchup and interaction to interaction</li>
                <li>Understanding this concept helps analyze how interactions play out and how effectively each character can influence frame advantage from neutral</li>

            <h2>Technical Frame Data: Drill Shine</h2>
            
            <h3>Frame Advantage Breakdown</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Drill has variable frame advantage depending on which frame you land</li>
                <li>It's difficult to intentionally go for the better frames consistently</li>
                <li><strong>On spacies:</strong> Worst-case frame advantage is 5 frames, best-case is 7 frames</li>
                <li>Since grab hits frame 7, if you're frame-perfect with best-case frame advantage, the grab is guaranteed</li>
                <li>Your timing gets to be more consistent than your opponent's, making it difficult for them to shine quickly enough even if they technically have time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Counterplay & Mixups</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best counterplay for the defender:</strong> Buffered spot dodge - gets out of the way if Fox isn't perfect and doesn't require crazy timing</li>
                <li><strong>Buffered roll is NOT fast enough</strong> - you can charge up smash or dash back and wait out the spot dodge</li>
                <li>Once opponents start buffering spot dodge, you can mix them up with charged upsmash or dash back wait</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Detailed Frame Data</h3>

            <h2>Neutral Game Concepts - Zamu</h2>
            
            <h3>Decision Making</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The most important thing for decision making and execution in any given situation in Melee: fully understand it, and it will be easier to look at. Learn each situation over and over again</li>
                <li>Play the RPS and then sprinkle everything else in</li>
                <li>There are other reasons why you should be beating people besides just adapting</li>
                <li>Attempt to always make decisions as humanly late as possible. Ideally every input you do should have been decided 15 frames before you do it. Kind of hard to do perfectly but what you should be aiming to do on a macro level</li>
                <li>Each time you look for a hit ask yourself "did I have the prerequisite advantage to do the thing I did?" and also "did I deserve to get a hit here?" If you ask yourself this and you say no, you probably shouldn't be attacking</li>
                <li>Be more careful about your move choices "does this move lead to a punish?" "does this move get me punished?"</li>
                <li>Choose less "read" options at the beginning of the game - wait like 5 or 10 more frames and dash dance which lets you react to a jump by seeing a short hop nair</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Situational Awareness</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Think more about the potential neutral win</li>
                <li>Don't lump spots together unless they need to be lumped together</li>
                <li>Don't think about how an opponent whiffed a move generally because you can be in so many different places</li>
                <li>Pick your spots to fight - the more you wait to fight the more likely you'll find a good opening</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Positioning & Stage Control</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Make your opponent prove that you have to be the one to approach, but that is never the case because of laser (i.e. Peach, Puff)</li>
                <li>Think more about what are good positions to be in rather than "I have a lead and my opponent needs to approach" or "I'm behind so I need to approach"</li>
                <li>Make your opponent force you to have a reason to approach rather than be pressured by attrition</li>
                <li>Approach when you need to approach and don't approach when you don't need to</li>
                <li>Take account of position and percent</li>
                <li>Practice staying in whiff punish range. Stop making hard reads - they are just straight up bad risk reward. It is basically just a very hopeful guess</li>
                <li>Look for clean neutral wins where if the opponent does something you can punish and if you don't you are still generally in advantage</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Stock & Percent Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stock lead means nothing in the ditto - percents matter a lot. Stock leads only matter if the game goes to time and game never goes to time in Fox dittos</li>
                <li>Percent matters if your opponent is higher than yours because if you just trade hits, you just win the game. Not necessarily what you want to be looking for - you want clean neutral because that situation is independent of the stock lead</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Movement & Spacing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>De-group your full hops (they are not grounded or actionable)</li>
                <li>If your opponent is just existing and you are full hopping you are at a mild disadvantage</li>
                <li>Make sure each full hop is individually fine and that you are not in full hop mode. Have a good reason for each full hop</li>
                <li>No reason to start drill high (unless you do FH drill and it combos on the ground) because you are aiming for your moves to hit and not whiff</li>
                <li>Replace giving up a lot of space to bait the opponent to move forward with aerial dash back or full hop in place</li>
                <li>If you are trying to corner pressure an opponent, give up space but not enough space to stop threatening your opponent</li>
                <li>Focus on using your movement to make the opponent uncomfortable</li>
                <li>To be patient - focus on doing nothing and keeping enough space between you and your opponent but still giving up space to dash dance into</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Patience & Not Attacking</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't attack if they are gonna whiff - the opponent doesn't know if you are doing a move or not, so you don't need to use that move!</li>
                <li>Focus on being actionable (specifically focus on not whiffing attacks that don't need to be whiffed) - stage position pressure</li>
                <li>Remove the spurts in your play where you give up on playing neutral entirely - take a deep breath</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Advantage State</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sometimes it's okay to hold a good position and you don't have to attack. As soon as you do something punishable you are no longer in an advantage state and can die</li>
                <li>As long as I play patient in advantage the risk reward is skewed in my favor</li>
                <li>When you have frame advantage, you know your opponent has to do something because they are in more lag than you are</li>
                <li>Don't bait your opponent - it is a more inconsistent way to play the game rather than just playing the position in a more simple manner</li>
                <li>Wait and screen look because the opponent needs to fight out of the corner regardless</li>
                <li>You are putting yourself in good positions but then you attack out of them and lose out on the value. Work on waiting to capitalize in these spots</li>
                <li>Start getting hit because you are not doing anything. When this happens, the opponent won the neutral game without getting a free hit, which is super duper sick</li>
                <li>Stop giving opponents free hits</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Corner Pressure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You don't have to nair into the corner because the opponent is already incentivized to fight out of the corner</li>
                <li>If the opponent isn't fighting for every 10 decisions, maybe you nair or running shine into the corner, or even pretend to do so - it's the threat that matters</li>
                <li>Figure out 4 options you want to do to corner pressure - be ready to hit him moving out of the corner</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Respawn Invincibility</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you respawn just play neutral - it is literally just Melee neutral but they can't hit you for a couple of seconds. You get to make a clean read in this moment</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How do I not get reversaled?</li>
                <li>How do I take my advantage as far as possible?</li>
                <li>Recognize when your combo is over and when the combo is over</li>
                <li>By playing you either: a) decrease disadvantage or b) find an advantage state</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Punish Game & Combo Extensions - Zamu</h2>
            
            <h3>Combo Theory</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Work on the up air follow up around 40 where the follow-up won't be a grab (could be platform, ledge, shy guys, etc.)</li>
                <li>Learning where to end the combo based on the situational variable - how does this become a kill?</li>
                <li>The correct answer in this case oftentimes is to reset to neutral</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tech Execution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice up throwing Fox onto BF / Stadium / Dreamland platform and doing full hop up air to cover 3/3 tech options</li>
                <li>Practice crouch canceling after whiffed aerials</li>
                <li>Short hop up air is good when the opponent is actionable - otherwise go for the full hop if you don't have time</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Marth Matchup Concepts - Billybopeep</h2>
            
            <h3>Neutral Game vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Marth doesn't have the way to defend himself in the corner like he does in the center</li>
                <li>If you are trying to whiff punish short hop fair range you want to be close enough that the drift does not do anything</li>
                <li>Full hop empty land and check what Marth does - this is faster than aerial and gives you visual time to confirm</li>
                <li>You can't ever hit anything Marth does with full hop unless you are preemptively doing it. This is part of the challenge against Marth in neutral</li>
                <li>Focus on knowing when Marth has to land - the spots that are coming up are spots where Marth has to land on the ground. These are the moments where you need to whiff punish Marth or pressure him</li>
                <li>If you don't have the frames to directly punish him you need to setup for pressure</li>
                <li>Apply aggressive dash back to whiff punish or pressure in these situations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Corner Pressure vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Be more willing to throw out hitboxes in the corner ONCE YOU HAVE MARTH IN THE ZONE NEAR THE INNER LIP</li>
                <li>The difference between Marth and Falco in the corner is that you can't get away with walling pressure - you have to pick a move sometimes and dash out</li>
                <li>As soon as you see Marth do a normal, the opportunity to whiff punish that is already over. Internalize that you need to read Marth doing something to hit him or change gears to pressure or position</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Movement vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Full hop drift neutral or drift away at Marth - never drift at Marth. If you do he will ALWAYS get away first and the moves he has are too fast + dash back</li>
                <li>If you are close enough to Marth and he doesn't know what's happening, if Marth is dashing toward you while you are dashing back it is not great because the decision tree becomes much more complicated</li>
                <li>What makes dash back offensively good: when Marth is in Fox's threat range he is constantly in a place where you can't react to Fox's aerials. It sets up the time so if Marth tries to stop you offensively you will be ready to hit him for it</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Punish Game vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Recognize when you have a meaningful hit, but not a direct combo, and what mixup needs to be played accordingly. Super important concept for fighting Marth</li>
                <li>If you are not sure if your shine will connect cleanly or at all, waveshine down</li>
                <li>On missed tech against Marth think about up tilt and short hop up air off of a knockdown</li>
                <li>DO NOT full hop falling bair - it does NOTHING against Marth EVER</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recovery vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If Marth is close to edge in a way where the up-B curls under the stage, you want to double jump back to refresh instead of Firefox</li>
                <li>Vertically far away = DJ back to refresh to cover yourself</li>
                <li>Horizontally far away = DJ in place to refresh to cover yourself</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tether Theory</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The tether is that if you are really far away from Marth you have to get close to Marth. You are either directly in front of Marth, or completely out of the range</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Laser Usage vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you are going to laser, stop picking offensive option after - it's detrimental</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Floaty Mid-Tier Concepts - Billybopeep</h2>
            
            <h3>Understanding Mid-Tier Characters</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mid tiers - they have less relevant options. Sit down and map out their real options</li>
                <li>You can teach someone how to approach a mid tier matchup in an hour - look at every move they have, what does the character's kit make their goals?</li>
                <li>Stop overgeneralizing - fight DK by knowing his linear neutral. You can just wait and laser and then do things that make it hard to interact. DK close range doesn't get much off of anything when facing forward</li>
                <li>X character has Y weakness and therefore because of X character and Y weakness I must play Z way</li>
                <li>Make generalizations that allow you to perceive the information correctly - the generalizations are not the answers themselves but instead the path to the answers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Character Weakness Analysis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Luigi's main weakness is that he doesn't have horizontal drift, which means that the angles he can approach from are limited. As Fox with unlimited movement, you can outmaneuver the Luigi player. The thought process is outmaneuvering Luigi by making it hard to find approach options</li>
                <li>Is there a way that I can decide to engage with this character? If so, how? If not, how do I minimize the engagement rate?</li>
                <li>Mid tiers are mid tiers because they are more vulnerable, and you can force situations where engagement is impossible</li>
                <li>You can simply run away, and sometimes they are unable to stop you because of their kit</li>
                <li>Picking proper engagement points is a key driving principle in theory for beating mid tier characters</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Neutral Strategy vs Mid-Tiers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay in slight advantage until you find a spot to engage in</li>
                <li>Respect the floaty mid tier kit - but don't respect the non-functional moves</li>
                <li>Know what is and isn't good in their kit and exploit them for doing the bad things</li>
                <li>Understand the character dynamic. Figure out the character weakness and engage with them properly (which implies correct timing)</li>
                <li>Do a variety of things - and don't do the same thing. Neutral is actually what is difficult for these characters, therefore once you do the same thing and they catch on they can do the thing where they potentially hit you really hard which is what makes them a mid tier and not a low tier</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Defense & Shield Game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Know what is and isn't shield grabbable. Understand inherent qualities of moves and their various applications (Fox nair, Falco shine, Marth nair, Sheik fair when L-canceled)</li>
                <li>Setup options in training mode and check if it's safe</li>
                <li>Understand what characters can do after a hit on shield. Sometimes you can just press the A button instead of shine OOS</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Punish Game vs Mid-Tiers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Figure out where the mid tier has no options and follow up and abuse punishes as a result of knowing that character can't do anything when you counter-hit</li>
                <li>They have to work really hard to do anything when you engage with their weaknesses directly</li>
                <li>Whiff landing lag of back air against Donkey Kong - this character doesn't have X option which makes Y option more reasonable</li>
                <li>Another example could be Samus down smash having way more lag than initially appears</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice Drills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Make save states of the whole cast approaching</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Combo Enders</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If your combo ender is an up air, and it doesn't kill, it usually is the wrong combo ender - consider up throw bair when you would normally try to finish the combo</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Kill Confirms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Work on hard DI away JC up smash kill confirms around 100%</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tech Execution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice drill shine link when they SDI away and try to shine first</li>

            <h3>Dash Back Framework</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your dash back is used to look and check and then you can use prediction confirmation off of the look and check</li>
                <li>This is all range dependent and will only work if both of you are inside each other's threat range</li>
                <li>Get better at whiff punishing - and get them to whiff using your movement - use the dash back look and check framework</li>
                <li>If you are actually close enough to threaten each other - that is the range where you can whiff punish</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Uncertainty & Panic Situations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When there is some uncertainty in these panic situations - wait for panic double jump bair and feel it out, then stand still and dash back and grab</li>
                <li>If you are uncertain of what your opponent is going to do, you should consider waiting until the last possible second you think you could get hit and then dash back and looking for a dash dance grab if you don't know what exactly they want</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Late Tech Chase Situations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you are extremely late on a tech chase - recognize that you are playing a mixup and use your space well accordingly</li>
                <li>You can bait him into attacking you - or nair him in the face</li>

            <h3>Recovery Timing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You have time to refresh when they are below the stage in the start of a Firefox - pay attention to the refresh</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Anti-Reversal Coverage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Turn around and back air if you think they are going to try to reversal you with a landing aerial</li>
                <li>You either get the chance to kill them for the double jump aerial or you are wrong and they go to ledge and they have to play out of disadvantage anyways</li>
                <li>To do this: do a late bair and drift away - do this really late and it will be really hard for them to hit you with the Firefox</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Chem's Fox Edgeguard Flowchart</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Do shine to cover the angle to ledge - this covers almost any angle that goes to ledge</li>
                <li>Any angle that DOESN'T go to ledge (bar a specific high angle) should cover the other options besides the ledge</li>
                <li>If they go high enough to the point where the bair from the shine back air whiffs, then you do another bair from the stage</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sheik Matchup - Zamu</h2>
            
            <h3>Combo Game vs Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>On full DI, you can combo with full hop but with no DI you have to do double jump up air</li>
                <li>Your biggest combos are from getting under Sheik and keeping her above you with up air and bair</li>
                <li>Double jump back bair on no invincibility Sheik back air</li>
                <li>Don't look for short hop up air on opponents above the platform because you are way farther than you would be when you land on the platform where you would be closer for more damage</li>
                <li>Practice reading Sheik jump with double jump up air</li>
                <li>How to hit a second hit up air - hit the highest possible point</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Up Throw Combos & DI Mixups</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mixup your drift on up throw up air - drift in the same way as the SDI you are expecting them to do</li>
                <li>Practice up throw up air with act out of wait (right now you are doing 4 frame DJ when it needs to be way faster)</li>
                <li>Build your intuition around how to do a combo - these are the kinds of things where if you have a full understanding of how you want to execute these things so it is not a question for you</li>
                <li>Given the variables, you know that you will not be able to hit something a certain way</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tech Chasing Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice full hop on frame 37 on Sheik to cover missed tech</li>
                <li>Up throw Sheik and then full hop falling up air which covers missed tech and a grab on the rolls. DON'T RUN ALL THE WAY TO THE CORNER ON THE ROLLS</li>
                <li>Practice teching down tilt and f tilt while being tech chased and scraps at higher percents. This will get you more mileage in scraps and disadvantage to get out of the bad situation sooner</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Edgeguarding Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>GRAB LEDGE AFTER HITTING SHEIK OFFSTAGE MORE OFTEN</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Platform Play vs Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Abuse CC on the platform</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Neutral & Decision Making vs Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Look for late nair</li>
                <li>Be more certain of what you want after landing</li>
                <li>Work on not rushing recoveries</li>
                <li>If it was not possible for you to get reversaled no matter what, what would you want?</li>
                <li>Be very specific with each action placed</li>
                <li>Do drop down shine because you want the shine to hit, not because you want to turn around</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mindset vs Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To maintain patience, think about what you know not to do</li>
            </ul>
