            <p>These are fundamental concepts and lessons learned through coaching sessions. Unlike player-specific notes, these focus on universal principles, mindset, and approach to improvement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-section">
            <h2>General Improvement & Mindset - Zamu</h2>
            
            <h3>Approach to Practice</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Play as if the opponent is the best at their respective character. You don't have to go up from there</li>
                <li>There's merit in beating players the same way versus playing better people. It won't help you beat Zain if you don't treat a worse Marth like Zain</li>
                <li>The goal isn't to beat your opponent but rather is to get better at the matchup</li>
                <li>If you are playing someone over and over and you are beating them the same way, stop playing that interaction - test them somewhere else</li>
                <li>Don't try to work on everything all at once. Pick very specific things, and call yourself out if you see yourself stopping doing that</li>
                <li>Play shorter sessions to be more intentional</li>
                <li>When Zamu plays someone way worse than her she does a lot worse, she'll do way better against the good player because she's not trying to outplay the worse opponent</li>
                <li>If your neutral game is strong it doesn't matter if you open them a lot. If you call them out and they are afraid of you, that's what matters</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Analysis & VOD Review</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you do analysis of your own VODs, look for where you miss kills and where you get killed</li>
                <li>Practice where you miss kills and get killed. These are the fast track options to getting really good</li>
                <li>Make a Google Drive notes for each character - what do I need to work on against this character?</li>
                <li>Be aware of the punish game that is about to occur but don't queue up an action. If you recognize you are late, play an action after</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice Methodology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice specific follow ups → take into account percent, position and DI. Don't get distracted!</li>
                <li>Use custom DI feature in UnclePunch!</li>
                <li>Start more with watching top players</li>
                <li>Make sure your success rate on follow-ups for the meaningful really hard things is high</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Practice Process</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Start off by doing the thing in the easiest way (i.e. waveshine upsmash on Sheik)</li>
                <li>Then move on to doing it from a standing shine</li>
                <li>Then space it farther back</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Practice Drills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice up throw up smash no DI tech chase and make sure to tech chase</li>
                <li>Practice with claw, and without claw for different situations, especially for tech chasing</li>
                <li>Practice waveshine upsmash on Peach, Falcon, Sheik, Marth</li>
                <li>Up throw up air on Puff</li>
                <li>Practice aerial dash back because otherwise aerial shine / aerial isn't on your opponent's mental stack</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-section">
            <h2>Common Noob Habits to Break - NMW</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section" style="background: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; padding: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">
                <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.8;">This is a list of problems that newer players consistently have. The list isn't comprehensive, but if you've been playing for less than 2 years, odds are you have at least a couple of these habits. If you can possibly watch footage of yourself, review it and note any of these habits. If you can't watch yourself, then just try to think about these things next time you play.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section" style="background: #f8d7da; border-left: 4px solid #dc3545; padding: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">
                <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.8; font-weight: 600;">Because decent players are cognizant of these bad habits, if you suffer from 2-3 of them, you are likely to be punished extremely hard, to the point that you don't have any chance of winning.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Recovery & Disadvantage Habits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Using your jump as soon as you get out of hitstun in the air</strong> - This is extremely predictable and gives your opponent a free punish</li>
                <li><strong>Recovering by jumping and attacking instead of jumping to the ledge</strong> - Going high with an attack is almost always worse than sweetspotting ledge</li>
                <li><strong>Only recovering in one way</strong> - Mix up your recovery options or you'll get read every time</li>
                <li><strong>Watching yourself getting comboed instead of trying to get out</strong> - Always be looking for DI mixups and escape options</li>
                <li><strong>Consistently doing survival DI instead of combo DI</strong> - Know when to DI to survive vs when to DI to escape combos</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Defensive Habits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Attacking when cornered</strong> - Often it's better to focus on escaping rather than throwing out moves</li>
                <li><strong>Mindless full hops when cornered</strong> - Full hopping in corner is extremely punishable</li>
                <li><strong>Excessive rolling</strong> - Rolling is predictable and easily punished, especially when done repeatedly</li>
                <li><strong>Excessive spot dodges</strong> - Spot dodge has long endlag and is easy to bait and punish</li>
                <li><strong>Excessive shield grabs</strong> - Shield grab is slow and doesn't work against spaced moves</li>
                <li><strong>Not respecting crouch cancel</strong> - At low percents, many moves get CC punished. Adjust your approach</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tech Chase & Ledge Habits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Teching in place too much</strong> - Tech in place is the easiest option to cover, mix it up</li>
                <li><strong>Tech rolling toward the center of the stage too much</strong> - This is extremely common and easily read. Note: Tech rolling toward center is common, but tech rolling away is rare (less than 5 noobs do this consistently vs 200+ who tech roll in)</li>
                <li><strong>Grabbing the ledge indiscriminately when ledgeguarding from the stage is better</strong> - Sometimes staying on stage gives you better coverage</li>
                <li><strong>Spamming ledgehop aerials, especially dair with spacies</strong> - This is predictable and often gets you killed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Neutral Game Habits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spamming finishing moves in neutral instead of combo starters</strong> - Use moves that lead to combos, not just kill moves</li>
                <li><strong>Going for hard reads when you don't have a read</strong> - Don't commit to risky options without reason</li>
                <li><strong>Going for a read in a reactable situation</strong> - If you can react to it, don't guess</li>
                <li><strong>Pointless movement, usually involving wavelands and platforms</strong> - Just because you can do a movement trick doesn't mean you should. Against Marth, for example, it's hardly ever actually a good idea to go to platforms</li>
                <li><strong>Trying to use moves that are just bad</strong> - Some moves have very limited utility, don't force them</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice & Mindset Habits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spamming an option because it works and not because it's good (specifically in friendlies)</strong> - This develops bad habits that won't work against better players</li>
                <li><strong>Trying to do too many things</strong> - Master specific setups and gradually build up your arsenal. Don't try to learn everything at once</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Break These Habits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Watch footage of yourself and actively look for these patterns</li>
                <li>Focus on breaking 1-2 habits at a time, not all of them at once</li>
                <li>Ask better players to call you out when they see these habits</li>
                <li>Be conscious of these habits during play and actively work against them</li>
                <li>Remember: These habits are so common that good players specifically look for and punish them</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-section">
            <h2>Ego and Improvement - NMW</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section" style="background: #e8f4f8; border-left: 4px solid #667eea; padding: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">
                <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.8; font-weight: 600;">Ego is one of the most common reasons why people plateau in their quest to become the best Melee players they can be. Ego interferes with improvement in many different ways. Even if you think you have your ego in check, you may realize in reading this that there are situations where it is at the heart of the problem, just not in an immediately apparent way.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Ego and Arrogance: Difficulty Taking Feedback</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>With ego comes arrogance, which results in difficulty taking feedback</li>
                <li>It can be hard to listen to someone who is way worse than you talk about the game</li>
                <li>We should make sure we don't neglect information about the game because it comes from an unexpected source</li>
                <li>Example: Top players have been told for years that powershielding doesn't reduce shieldstun - Melee is full of mysterious mechanics and no one knows everything</li>
                <li>More commonly, ego makes us unable to take criticism about our gameplay</li>
                <li>Sometimes players worse than you can notice bad habits or deficiencies that aren't obvious to you</li>
                <li>Ego might even be what obfuscates these deficiencies</li>
                <li>Different players look at the game in different ways, so don't ignore the possibility of insight from anyone</li>
                <li><strong>This is particularly relevant in doubles</strong> - ego is by far the most problematic thing in social dynamics between teammates</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ego and Work Ethic: Complacency</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Work ethic is important for improvement at anything and is one of the most common deficiencies in Melee players</li>
                <li>Ego can damage your work ethic because of complacency and arrogance</li>
                <li>You might have been able to do 100 perfect ledgedashes last week, so you feel like you don't need to practice it anymore</li>
                <li><strong>Reliable tech skill comes at the price of eternal vigilance</strong></li>
                <li>Don't neglect practicing your bread and butter "because you're already good at it"</li>
                <li>How many hours do you think Armada and M2K have spent comboing CPUs? Yet they still beat up CPUs before getting on stage</li>
                <li>Work ethic doesn't just mean practicing tech skill - it means maintaining the same fire you had when you were getting wrecked by your rival month after month</li>
                <li>If you lost to someone for years, then beat them week after week, it's easy to fall into complacency</li>
                <li>Regardless of how good you are, you still need to go to tournaments and work on implementing new things</li>
                <li>The beauty of Melee is that there is no skillcap - we should all strive to implement new things and polish our gameplay until the end of days</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ego and Johning</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't tell yourself that after you lose a friendly to an arcadian that you would have won if it were tournament</li>
                <li>Think about what you can learn from the game you just played</li>
                <li>Don't john to protect your ego</li>
                <li>It's easy to attribute losing to factors outside of your control</li>
                <li>But factors outside your control are just that - outside your control</li>
                <li>Hence, it's pointless to focus on them, because your own deficiencies are within your realm of influence</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ego Makes You Isolate Yourself</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ego makes you isolate yourself from situations that potentially damage it</li>
                <li>We all have friends who do disproportionately well against us for what our supposed respective skill levels are</li>
                <li>Most of us hate playing these people - our egos hate that we do worse than we feel we should</li>
                <li><strong>The fact is that these are people you should actively seek out to play</strong> - their playstyle exploits weaknesses in your own</li>
                <li>Ego makes us want to avoid situations where we can get upset in tournament, or even avoid giving someone a runback after beating them</li>
                <li>Don't avoid matches because you "have nothing to prove"</li>
                <li>Don't seek out matches because you have to prove something for the sake of your ego</li>
                <li>To improve as rapidly as possible, you should play as much as possible against players who can potentially beat you</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ego and Tournament Performance: Being in the Moment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Expectations for results are an understandable reality of being a competitor</li>
                <li>However, having your ego tied to these results can take you out of the moment</li>
                <li>Our lives are the cumulation of a series of present moments - there is nothing you can do to change the past</li>
                <li>The present has a deterministic relationship to the future, such that the only way to affect the future is through the decisions we make in the present</li>
                <li>The future does not exist as anything except an intangible idea</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Don't Let Ego Distract You During Sets</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't let your ego make you worry about intangible meaningless concerns</li>
                <li>When playing a tournament set, all your focus should be dedicated to:</li>
                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem;">
                    <li>What your opponent is doing</li>
                    <li>What they're likely to do</li>
                    <li>What options are available to you to counter theirs</li>
                </ul>
                <li>This is the last time you want to have thoughts creeping in about results</li>
                <li>The easiest way to get upset by someone you "should" beat is to start thinking about:</li>
                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem;">
                    <li>What people are going to say about you losing</li>
                    <li>How losing will affect your power ranking</li>
                    <li>How you should be winning</li>
                    <li>How you are so much better than your opponent</li>
                </ul>
                <li>All of these thoughts are inextricably linked to your ego</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on the game and not perception of your skill</strong></li>
                <li>Learning to silence your ego and have stillness of mind will result in your performance being better and vastly more consistent</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summary: Overcoming Ego</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Accept feedback from all sources, regardless of skill level</li>
                <li>Maintain work ethic even when you're winning</li>
                <li>Don't john - focus on what you can control</li>
                <li>Seek out players who exploit your weaknesses</li>
                <li>Stay in the present moment during tournament sets</li>
                <li>Focus on the game, not on results or perception</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Melee Journey: Embracing the Ride - NMW</h2>
            
            <h3>The Narrative Fallacy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Melee community is fantastic - we have a culture of responsibility and self improvement</li>
                <li>"No johns" is ingrained into our culture, even though johns are often legitimate</li>
                <li>Our game attracts people with a tryhard, give it your all, work hard to become the best type attitude</li>
                <li>People like this often think of their Melee journeys as a narrative, where they train hard until they become the best</li>
                <li><strong>This isn't how it tends to go</strong></li>
                <li>This isn't Pokemon where you catch 150 muthafuckas, beat some league culminating in a match against your rival, and the game ends</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Unpredictability of the Journey</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The old guard in NorCal Melee (Sheridan, Germ, Boback) probably didn't expect to end up where they are now</li>
                <li>Their crew was called "death by esports" - who knew Genesis would turn into what it has become today?</li>
                <li>When joining the community in 2012, Melee was not popping like it is today</li>
                <li>Nobody thought they would make money off the game even if they became one of the best players</li>
                <li>Nobody expected Captain Falcon would have a renaissance, or that it would come from Florida players</li>
                <li>Nobody expected to fall in love with Melee doubles (especially those who hate teamwork in other games)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Community Over Competition</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A lot of older community members come out to tournaments to kick it with homies more than to play Melee</li>
                <li>Their friends mean more to them than the game</li>
                <li>But nonetheless, the reason we are close is ultimately Melee</li>
                <li>Every now and then, even people who don't have that same fire to improve watch some videos or have conversations about the game, and it awakens their thirst to play</li>
                <li>The game is just so fucking good</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Don't Lose the Fun</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't lose the fun because you are attached to results</li>
                <li>Sometimes just remembering to have fun can make you get better results</li>
                <li>Example: Being very tryhard and serious at Big House 6 vs taking the opposite road at Genesis by competing in doubles, doing commentary, and consuming tons of alcohol - might do just as well in singles either way</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Non-Linear Improvement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Remember that your journeys of improvement aren't linearly upward</li>
                <li>They are more like a squiggly line with ups and downs: ~~~~/~~~</li>
                <li>Overall, your results should get better over time, but no one is going to be perfectly consistent</li>
                <li>Even the best baseball teams lose several dozen games a season</li>
                <li>You'll have bad days</li>
                <li>You might switch characters</li>
                <li>You might become complacent because you don't have good competition</li>
                <li>Don't lose sight of your goals and remember that we push ourselves because of love for the game</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Keep Playing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you really have a deep love for the game, don't let social things or other factors come between you and touching the controller</li>
                <li>Hell, we even have netplay now - something that was never expected to become popular in regions with people to play against</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Life as Sailing, Not Driving</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Enjoy the ride and embrace that we aren't in full control of where things go</li>
                <li>Part of the adventure of life is going forward into the unknown and faring it</li>
                <li><strong>Life is more like sailing an ancient boat that couldn't go upwind than it is like driving a car</strong></li>
                <li>We have some limited control over how we steer, but we mostly go where the tradewinds take us</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Appreciate the Community</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Enjoy the people you meet in the community</li>
                <li>Be enriched by the diversity of Melee players - this community has some real fucking characters from so many walks of life</li>
                <li>Express yourself through the controller</li>
                <li>Be thankful that we found Melee, because the game is beautiful</li>
                <li>As someone who spent more than half of his life in competitive gaming: other games are not as satisfying, and their communities are much less awesome than ours</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The 5 Steps to Getting Good - NMW</h2>
            
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Plateaus exist at all levels of play - it's usually a lack of knowledge about how to practice intelligently, not lack of practice itself</li>
                <li>The optimal way to improve is to learn things in an order based on both ease and usefulness</li>
                <li>As you start to master one step, you'll slowly shift focus to the next until everything from previous steps is subconscious</li>
                <li>Muscle memory is essential for getting SHFFLs down, but autopilot is the enemy of mindful improvement</li>
                <li>You should continually evaluate your habits at every step - old habits die hard</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 1: Tech Skill</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with short hops, SHFFLs, and wavedashes</li>
                <li>Move on to character-specific technology (Up+B OOS for Samus, reverse lasers for Falco, pivots for Falcon, etc.)</li>
                <li>This phase is about learning basic tech skill, not truly difficult stuff like haxdashes</li>
                <li>Mastering a technique in solo practice is only the first step - then you have to learn to do it under pressure, then learn how to apply it</li>
                <li>Application is generally learned by spamming it and figuring out which situations it's useful in through trial and error</li>
                <li>Don't expect to master this in less than a few months - experienced players forget how hard it is to have control when starting out</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Punish Game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Though neutral game is arguably more important, punish game is easier to focus on</li>
                <li>Punish game, like tech skill, is largely contingent on your own execution and not on interaction with the opponent</li>
                <li>Master your own hitboxes, learn your frame data, and learn to be precise with your character</li>
                <li>This is when good players can most easily give good advice - solicit it as soon as your tech skill is solid</li>
                <li>Most people plateau during this phase because they don't give it adequate focus</li>
                <li>Improving control and punish game is one of the easiest and most gratifying ways to improve</li>
                <li>Your first year or two is best spent learning to have perfect control over your own character</li>
                <li>Your own style will start to emerge during this step</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: DI</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>DI takes focus on the opponent - you have to watch them, not yourself</li>
                <li>Really, if you're a competent player, you should be watching your opponent all the time and never focusing on yourself</li>
                <li>This takes too much concentration for a new player - focusing on it sooner will impede improvement of other things</li>
                <li>After you start to notice and understand DI, this will help expand your repertoire of punishes</li>
                <li>New players go for killing moves in the first possible setup. Experienced players do autocombos or bread and butter extensions. Great players trick opponents' DI to artificially extend combos</li>
                <li>As you learn to watch your opponent and not yourself, you'll start to gain insight into neutral game (though this knowledge may be subconscious)</li>
                <li>To have good DI, you need to understand when your opponent wants to attack</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Neutral Game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This is when you're actually starting to play Melee in a way comparable to respected players</li>
                <li>Learn everything about every character: ranges, recovery options, frame data, positional weaknesses, etc.</li>
                <li>Time to start theorycrafting and truly understand the utility of all your options</li>
                <li>Learn to analyze videos - understand why players choose to do what they do, not just admire combos</li>
                <li>Watch videos with analysis by top players and make sure you understand everything they say</li>
                <li>You'll get hype over things you didn't notice before, and things you got hype over before will seem standard</li>
                <li>The beauty of the game doesn't really shine through until you're at this stage</li>
                <li>Stage control and momentum of the match will start to make sense</li>
                <li>After hearing "rolling is bad" for years, this is when you finally have enough situational understanding to bait and punish them</li>
                <li>Once you understand the options a character has, the brilliance behind top players' decisions becomes clear</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 5: Innovation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You've watched many videos and understand your own limitations</li>
                <li>You're making few bad decisions, and when you do, you either understand and regret it or solicit advice</li>
                <li>You've been expanding your bag of tricks since step 2 - movement options are now clear in their application</li>
                <li>You don't drop combos anymore and have all the expected skills of a competitive player</li>
                <li>Your own style will have started to emerge in step 2, but this is where you harness your strengths and search for small optimizations</li>
                <li>As an aspiring player, you won't beat people better than you just by copying what they do - this is that last 10%</li>
                <li>Polish everything and incorporate every new thing you can. Deign to have truly difficult tech skill as consistent as easy tech skill</li>
                <li>Make sure the most useful things are the things you dedicate the most time to be consistent with</li>
                <li>Until you're in step 4, you aren't really in a position to innovate - you need deep understanding of positioning and situations to implement new things</li>
                <li>Step 5 helps you break plateaus in step 4 - it's how you get new options out of sticky situations and trick people with unexpected options</li>
                <li>In a close tournament set, if you use something once and it gets you one kill, it was worthwhile</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Important Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Steps 4 and 5 are the most blurred in their lines - no one ever truly masters neutral game because it isn't truly masterable</li>
                <li>If you practice mindfully, your rate of improvement should generally increase as you get better</li>
                <li>Learning matchups is terribly difficult if you're still in step 2, but you'll pick them up rapidly if you're in step 5</li>
                <li>With the right partner, a matchup could go from being one of your worst to one of your best in a day</li>
                <li>Most players face plateaus because they don't have direction - use available resources to direct your practice</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Teams as a Learning Tool</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For fun and growth, learning teams should happen during steps 2 and 3</li>
                <li>If you can precisely place attacks, you can play teams. DI is easier in teams because holding in is good most of the time</li>
                <li>Rolling and bad tech habits are less problematic in teams</li>
                <li>You'll get more out of playing continuously than losing every game in a four-man rotation</li>
                <li>The intricate dance of the singles neutral game can be entirely circumvented - all you need is to play your role</li>
                <li>As a low level player, your chances of beating good players is immensely higher in teams than in singles</li>
                <li>Though the skillset is different in doubles, it's much easier to do your role and be a good teams player than to learn the subtleties of singles neutral game</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Practice Effectively - NMW</h2>
            
            <h3>The Problem with "Fake It Till You Make It"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Coming from RTS, people often hear they should blindly copy top players until they understand them</li>
                <li>This is awful advice in Melee - doing things you don't understand the purpose behind is terrible</li>
                <li>Your hands should never move faster than your brain, unless you're one of the 1% of people like n0ne or Mango who are actually good at playing solely on feel</li>
                <li>Emulating players without understanding why they do things will stifle your improvement</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice Useful Things</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It can be difficult as a newer player to recognize what's useful and what isn't</li>
                <li>If you aren't at least an upper-mid level player, it's unlikely that any of your ideas for next level tech are useful</li>
                <li>If struggling to find useful things to practice, look at the paragons of your character - Leffen, Wizzrobe, Plup, etc.</li>
                <li>Though no one has a maxed out toolkit, watching optimal/standard players should give you plenty to practice</li>
                <li>If you've practiced something to the point you can execute it, but after a month you still can't integrate it into gameplay, it might be time to abandon that idea</li>
                <li>Not every technique needs to fit into your style - you'll probably learn something during attempted implementation even if unsuccessful</li>
                <li>Ledge play is something most people with most characters could spend a lot of time polishing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For Newcomers: The Color Overlay</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The single best thing you could do to improve is to get 20XX and turn on the color overlay for wait state and missed L-cancels</li>
                <li>Get rid of all your idle frames - this will make the most difference out the gate</li>
                <li>The color overlay does not work when you're airborne or in IASA frames, so don't neglect your fastfalls or movement out of grounded moves</li>
                <li>The two most important things for being good at Melee are movement and knowledge of situations</li>
                <li>Movement you can grind out and rapidly improve at</li>
                <li>Knowledge of situations comes through experience and having an active mind, both in the game and between sessions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Playing vs Practicing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Playing Melee is not necessarily practicing Melee</li>
                <li>Your brain should be fully engaged and you should have several things in mind you want to practice going into every session</li>
                <li>Your skill level and your partner's skill level should directly influence what you practice</li>
                <li>If you are still new, practice tech skill, DI, and punish game</li>
                <li>At any level, there's still punish mixups and tech skill to work on - the worse your opponent is, the more you should focus on these things</li>
                <li>If you're a mid level player against another mid level player or better, neutral game will probably occupy a large portion of your cognitive load</li>
                <li>Improving neutral game is harder to dedicate focus to within a practice regiment - you'll do much of your learning implicitly</li>
                <li>If playing fuck around games, don't dedicate more than half your focus to neutral</li>
                <li>Neutral game is best practiced when at peak focus against better players who are actively trying to counter you</li>
                <li>If you aren't really in the zone, focus on practicing punish game and technical techniques - these areas translate most readily into glaring improvements</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Punish Game Against Different Skill Levels</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Even if your punish game is good, it might not be good against someone with better defense than your common opponents</li>
                <li>Punish and offensive mixups are likely to work on bad players but may not work on better ones</li>
                <li>Work on recognizing situations and execution, but don't get it worked into muscle memory to indiscriminately cover certain scrubby things</li>
                <li>Better players navigate defensive situations much better than nooby friends</li>
                <li>Examples: recovering when off stage, getting out of the corner, moving out of shield (especially after a late aerial on shield)</li>
                <li>Always be diligent in thinking about how someone might escape and what options might cover their escape</li>
                <li>Your friends may not have good SDI, but top players do - develop ideas for how to cover options against better players</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Avoiding Practice Partner Metagames</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Part of getting the most out of practice is recognizing which practice on your opponent will generalize to other players</li>
                <li>The fewer practice partners you have, the more you will develop metagames just to beat them, which may even harm you when you play someone else</li>
                <li>Example: If you only practice against a Sheik who likes to run at you and fight, you might be very good against them but very bad against Sheik in general</li>
                <li>If only exposed to a style where your opponent runs at you, you'll have no idea how to deal with planking, platform camping, standing in corner and throwing needles, etc.</li>
                <li>When people say "x is so good at a matchup because they practice with y," this is almost always bullshit - they're just good at the player matchup</li>
                <li>No one plays every style of a character</li>
                <li>Overstating the relevance of character matchups and understating the value of style vs style or player vs player matchups is among the most common fallacies in our scene</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Categorizing Practice by Opponent Skill Level</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The order of categories here correlate to the skill level of your opponent - focus entirely on the first categories if your opponents are bad, and work your way up as the quality of your opponents increases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Things useful against everyone:</strong> Spacing moves at their tip, grabbing the ledge quickly, ledgedashing</li>
                <li><strong>Guaranteed punishes:</strong> Bear in mind that things that feel guaranteed against your friends may not actually be guaranteed</li>
                <li><strong>Things that are generally good:</strong> Avoid spamming gimmicks as that will inevitably stifle improvement. There's a big difference between things that work and things that are good. Good is mostly a function of risk/reward - good things should be hard to punish, or they should have extremely high reward based on a correct and not outlandish read. Cover as many options as safely as possible, or cover an option with extreme potency</li>
                <li><strong>Ways to trick your opponent:</strong> Actual mindgames and trickery are unlikely to be relevant until a higher level. At lower levels you can just wait for someone to do something stupid. Even if they don't do stupid things, you might struggle to trick someone because they lack situational understanding - someone might be too stupid to roll or spotdodge because they don't understand they're pressured</li>
                <li><strong>If playing someone much better than you:</strong> Put extensive focus on getting out of bad situations by doing things like good SDI, crisp wavedashes out of shield, Amsah techs, etc. This builds situational awareness</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>People suck at getting good at games for innumerable reasons</li>
                <li>This guide assumes you have regular access to practice partners that aren't complete noobs and that you don't lack proper motivation</li>
                <li>Mentality problems are a common reason for stifled improvement</li>
                <li>Despite the fact that you can improve at Melee in infinitely many ways, eliminating idle frames and improving movement will make the most difference early on</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Think About Neutral Game - NMW</h2>
            
            <h3>The Problem: People Don't Use Their Brain</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>People are not proficient at using their brain while playing</li>
                <li>Things that seem obvious or self-evident to some are not intuitive to others</li>
                <li>Some of the best players are unable to articulate even basic things about how they play and why they do what they do</li>
                <li>If you don't feel like you're playing with an intuitive understanding of what's going on, you need to exercise your critical thinking skills</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Most Important Skills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Most important:</strong> Understanding situations</li>
                <li><strong>Second most important:</strong> Movement</li>
                <li>People know to grind movement, but without knowledge of how to apply your movement, you probably won't be able to get ranked in any remotely competitive region</li>
                <li>Dr. PP once pointed out that many players are really good at looking cool between stocks but have no idea how to apply it in their play - don't let this be you</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Case Study: Lord (Falcon)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lord has great tech skill, but it's nothing crazy and he doesn't do much next level stuff in terms of movement</li>
                <li>He probably moves less than any other top Falcon ever has</li>
                <li>The only thing he really has over other Falcons is choosing the right choices in microsituations (which goes hand in hand with his excellent use of crouch cancel)</li>
                <li>He's sometimes able to win sets against top players just by reaching deep into his bag of gimmicks and repeatedly tricking them in a few situations he has a better understanding of</li>
                <li>He spams all kinds of unsafe things that can be countered, but he's good at reading you and knows janky options that beat all the conventional ones</li>
                <li>This demonstrates that situational understanding can overcome technical deficiencies</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Active Thinking During Play</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You should be continually thinking about what your opponent is doing and how to counter it</li>
                <li>If you aren't picking options that specifically counter things you think your opponent is going to do, you are either being wishful that your opponent is bad or you are Hax$</li>
                <li>When you get hit, ask yourself why</li>
                <li>Try to come up with answers for the situation in which you got hit, or try to figure out how to avoid the situation altogether</li>
                <li>Don't be afraid to solicit advice from better players - Melee nerds love talking about Melee</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Weighted Rock Paper Scissors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ultimately, fighting games are all games of weighted rock paper scissors</li>
                <li>Certain options beat certain options but the risk/reward is skewed</li>
                <li>Don't be afraid to throw something out that's high risk if you have a strong reason to believe it's going to beat what they are going to do</li>
                <li>It's very rare to find someone whose actions are totally unpredictable</li>
                <li>Look for situations where you can take advantage of the habits of the opponent</li>
                <li>Look to avoid doing any defensive things because of autopilot</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Key Question</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If someone asks you "what does that option beat?" you should have an answer related to what you have been seeing your opponent doing</li>
                <li>Every option you choose should be intentional and based on what you expect your opponent to do</li>
                <li>This applies to all aspects of the game, but is especially relevant to ledgeguarding, which is frequently one of the areas that could use the most improvement in players' skillsets</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Movement without situational understanding is useless</li>
                <li>Always be thinking about why you're choosing each option</li>
                <li>Study your opponent's habits and exploit them</li>
                <li>Don't autopilot - every decision should be deliberate</li>
                <li>When in doubt, ask better players for advice</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Counterintuitive Things in Melee - NMW</h2>
            
            <h3>Practicing for Hours Doesn't Make You Perfect</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practicing something for hours on end does not make you perfect at it</li>
                <li>When practicing for extensive periods, you get in a groove that you will never be in at a tournament</li>
                <li>Stimulus conditions vary greatly - you will never be in that same mental state at a tournament</li>
                <li>You will be focused on playing your opponent, not on ledgedashing</li>
                <li>Doing things in tournament is different than in your room - you aren't going to get nervous and choke in your room</li>
                <li><strong>Best practice method:</strong> Practice things frequently in short bursts, for ~10 minutes a day, or 10 minutes a few different times in a day</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Copying the Best Players Doesn't Make You One of Them</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In other games, you can fake it until you make it - emulate top players and let understanding follow as execution improves</li>
                <li>This does not work well in Melee</li>
                <li>Even if you think you are copying top players, what they are doing is probably different from what you are doing</li>
                <li>They have extensive understanding of situations and their opponent's mental state</li>
                <li>If you try to do what Norwalk players do, you are probably just going to look stupid</li>
                <li>If you are still bent on copying top players, pick ones that play standard, optimal styles, e.g. Wizzrobe</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Striking to Bad Stages Can Be Good</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If your opponent has 2 counterpicks in a BO3 and you are confident he will pick the one you don't ban, consider starting on that stage</li>
                <li>Often, the way you play on bad counterpicks doesn't say much about your overall strategy</li>
                <li>You might learn your opponent better there than he can learn you</li>
                <li>You also might prefer losing game 1 and having a winnable game 3 over having to play on their best CP game 3</li>
                <li>Similar logic can apply to BO5</li>
                <li>You can still opt to strike to something more neutral in any case, but don't neglect the possibility of striking to a bad stage if you're going to have to play on it later in the set anyway</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Longer Dashes Aren't Always Better</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Having a character that can crouch out of run quickly offers them options that characters with longer dashes don't have</li>
                <li>Cactuar dash offers a similar movement option to dash dance for these characters</li>
                <li>It lets you implement crouching into your movement very nicely</li>
                <li>Even if your character has a long dash, be sure to work on dash dancing different lengths</li>
                <li>Sometimes a good tight dash dance can be indispensable</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sometimes It's Better to Not Hit Someone; Sometimes Getting Hit Is Good</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>In doubles:</strong> Hitting someone out of the corner with a move that doesn't hit them far off the other side of the stage can be really bad - sometimes hitting someone lets their team regain stage position</li>
                <li><strong>In singles:</strong> Sometimes hitting people ends up with you in a worse position as well</li>
                <li>You can go off with a weak knee, then let your opponent recover before you</li>
                <li>Sometimes hitting people lets them DI and slide to the ledge, so it might have been better to do something like let their shield decay more instead of going for the poke</li>
                <li>Not all openings are equal - be calculated about how you want to hit someone</li>
                <li>Crouch canceling really comes into play here, because sometimes the person who lands the first hit can immediately be punished, even if they try to do it safely</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Guaranteed Followups Can Be Worse Than Non-Guaranteed Ones</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Opportunities are fleeting in Melee</li>
                <li>Sometimes you have reads and you can be confident that you are correct</li>
                <li>In these situations, going for what's guaranteed can be squandering an opportunity that you might not get again</li>
                <li>If you always go for a regrab, you are giving your opponents extra chances to DI to safety</li>
                <li>Seize opportunities when they are there, and end your opponent's stocks when given the chance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Not Approaching Can Be Good Even When You're Losing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Melee has 8 minutes on the clock</li>
                <li>Taking 1-2 minutes off by forcing the game to be played at your pace can be extremely helpful</li>
                <li>By slowing the game down, you can make the opponent play at your pace, not theirs</li>
                <li>Most people get frustrated and approach</li>
                <li>Unless your opponent is actually going to wait out the clock (very few players are disciplined enough to not get cheesed by this), you can get away with camping when you're losing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Doing Things That "Should Never Work" Can Be Super Good</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Top players, especially ones from WC like Shroomed, S2J, Mango, and Lord do all kinds of things that "shouldn't" work</li>
                <li>But they read their opponent, sensing either their habits in game or their mental state outside of the game, and know they can get away with things</li>
                <li>You can even condition your opponents to expect something standard and sensible, then flip the situation on its head by doing something really stupid that they don't expect</li>
                <li>This works really well if you can sense that your opponent is nervous or choking</li>
                <li>You can actually read that someone is choking or that they are going to flub an input</li>
                <li>Sometimes doing something that "shouldn't work" leads to the best possible outcome</li>
                <li>If you are unwilling to do things because they shouldn't work against some TAS bot, you are squandering opportunities</li>
                <li>No Melee player is perfect - look for the imperfections of your opponent and take advantage</li>
                <li><strong>Warning:</strong> Don't do this habitually when playing friendlies against noobs because then you'll develop numerous bad habits</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sometimes Doing Moves Extremely Slowly Is Good</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Delaying moves to the last possible frames often looks stupid, but if you get good at it, the rewards will be huge</li>
                <li>People have timing windows where they expect their opponents to throw out their moves</li>
                <li>This is only natural because things like dash dances and jumps have a rhythm to them</li>
                <li>Play outside the conventional rhythm and you can make people look stupid</li>
                <li>They end up getting caught or baited by unexpected timings</li>
                <li>Even something as stupid as missing the dash dance or "Gould dashing" can lead to a timing mixup, where something that looks retarded ends up getting rewarded</li>
                <li>If you are skeptical about this point or the previous one, just remember that Mattdotzeb beat Leffen</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Not All Kills Are Equal - Emotional Damage Is Real</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Emotional damage is a thing - you can cause people to crumble by ending their stocks in painful ways</li>
                <li>The mental game is a thing, and you can gain mental advantages by devastating opponents in unexpected ways</li>
                <li>Have you ever seen someone SD and then fall apart right after that?</li>
                <li>Or how about that time Darkrain phantomed his kill move, then was unable to regain any footing for the rest of the match?</li>
                <li>It's possible to intentionally cause these decisive moments in the match</li>
                <li>If you see a way to get a particularly humiliating kill, or a chance to kill your opponent in a way he may have never seen before, go for it</li>
                <li>Getting into your opponent's head is a serious advantage</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>RPS, Match Flow, and Stage Selection - NMW</h2>
            
            <h3>Understanding Gameplans</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you read any Reddit thread where someone solicits metagame advice, you'll see oversimplifications about how to play matchups</li>
                <li>These oversimplifications are useful because they delineate a general gameplan</li>
                <li>Then with experience, players add more nuanced tactics to their gameplan</li>
                <li>Gameplans are based on using your character's tools to exploit the weaknesses of the opponent's character and to avoid their character's strengths</li>
                <li>As you play more and talk theorycraft with good players, you'll develop a good idea of what characters excel at</li>
                <li>This should give you an idea what to expect when you go into a set even against an unfamiliar opponent</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Predicting Match Flow</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Though not much of a gameplan type player, there are still certain situations, both in punish and neutral, that define matchups</li>
                <li>You should have an idea how games are going to look in matches on different stages with some degree of accuracy (70% ballpark)</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> "Against Puff on Dreamland, Fox will attempt to shoot lasers, run away to platforms, play evasively, then punish Puff when opportunities present themselves. Puff will therefore try to play cautiously to avoid overextending and will try to call out Fox's escape options to end the cycle of camping."</li>
                <li>This outline has implications for adaptations that will take place during a set</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Developing Your RPS Tree</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Certain options beat other options - that's the nature of fighting games</li>
                <li>All of your bread and butter has counters</li>
                <li>You need to be ready to do the next option that beats the option that beat your first option</li>
                <li><strong>Ideally, you want to be at least three layers deep</strong> - have an idea of what your rock, paper, and scissors are that will beat theirs as they adapt to you</li>
                <li>If you only have rock and paper, you'll be out of mixups by the end of the first game, maybe even the second stock</li>
                <li>When practicing, your goal should be to develop a huge tree of options, where the leaves of the branches are subtle changes that can throw off your opponent</li>
                <li>Example: Drifting back after an aerial on shield instead of fastfalling it</li>
                <li>Then you'll be able to use this tree in tournament instead of having to innovate on the spot, which can be extremely difficult</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Stages and Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stages lend themselves to certain strategies</li>
                <li>Different strategies even within the same character matchup effect drastically different paces</li>
                <li>Think Fox/Puff on Dreamland versus on Yoshi's - completely different pace</li>
                <li>Because of the RPS nature of the game, the pace of matches can be predicted</li>
                <li>You want to pick stages that affect the flow of the match in a favorable way</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Stage Selection Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example 1 - Buying Time:</strong> "Ralph runs me over. I need time to figure out how to deal with his speed. Therefore, going to large stages first favors me."</li>
                <li><strong>Example 2 - Saving Counterpicks:</strong> "I always counterpick Yoshi's against Samus because I think it's a free win for Falcon. However, last time I played Darrell, in game 2 on FoD, I was getting stuck in shield, cornered, and grabbed a ton. Therefore, I opted for Stadium in game 3, saving Yoshi's for game 5 because I needed additional space to regain my composure and assess my neutral. Picking Stadium game 3 increased my chances of winning both games 3 and 5."</li>
                <li><strong>Example 3 - Learning Opponent Style:</strong> "n0ne does not like FD against Fox. However, he says that playing FD first lets him learn the Fox's style, and he gets this stage out of the way. Therefore, when he's fighting in close quarters on Fox's other CPs later in the set, he has a better idea of their tendencies and how to win scuffles."</li>
                <li><strong>Example 4 - Information Gathering:</strong> "PPMD opts to stay Marth on Dreamland in game 5 of the first set of Apex 2015 grand finals. PP said that though his Falco was looking sharp and he might have been able to deal with Armada's Peach, he needed to figure it out with Marth. If it went to set 2, he would not have felt he could do it if he had not gotten additional information from more Marth games."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Striking Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Note that because of how striking goes or based on conditions that arise on tournament day, you may deviate from these ideas</li>
                <li>Example: Always starting on Yoshi's against Ralph because never striking to FD, and he strikes Dreamland+BF</li>
                <li>Sometimes choosing to strike to FoD because of information even though it's a horrendous Falcon stage</li>
                <li>The nature of counterpick stages is that your character will not play the same way they will play on other stages</li>
                <li>This is why these stages are counterpicks - they take you out of the comfort zone for your character, nerfing your bread and butter</li>
                <li>Ergo, you can learn more about your opponent on FoD than they can about you</li>
                <li>You're not gonna spend any time in subsequent games stomping platforms, ledge canceling, and spamming shield drops</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Anticipating Match Evolution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Gameplans have implications for how the match will evolve, which you can skew with stage selection</li>
                <li><strong>Example - Ralph (Fox) vs Floatie:</strong> "Ralph is very fast and aggressive. A logical pace: Ralph initially runs floatie player over. Floatie player figures out ways to avoid shielding, focuses on SDI to punish some of Ralph's less safe aggression, and slows down the neutral, taking away Ralph's momentum, which can be crucial for an aggressive player."</li>
                <li>In this situation, Ralph does not want to start on a small stage, even though small stages favor aggressive players</li>
                <li>Ideally, he probably wants to start on Battlefield, on which he can be aggressive</li>
                <li>Big stages might be too big for him to be aggressive and gain the momentum that he wants</li>
                <li>Small stages he might want to save for later, after the player has made some defensive adaptations, to resume smothering them</li>
                <li>When saying small stages, mostly mean Yoshi's, but in Ralph's case, he is so tight and fast with shield drop aggression, smothering someone on FoD is also a possibility</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn to anticipate how the flow of a match is going to go</li>
                <li>Experiment with stage selection to give yourself a better idea what boons a stage gives you, which strengths it takes away, and how it affects the flow of the match</li>
                <li>Don't neglect the flow of the match going into your opponent's counterpick</li>
                <li>Remember that they picked a stage because of specific advantages and try to neuter those advantages with adaptations of your own</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="concept-section">
            <h2>Locals vs Nationals - NMW</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section" style="background: #e8f4f8; border-left: 4px solid #667eea; padding: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">
                <p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.8;">It's commonly believed in our community that nationals are the true test of Melee skill and that locals don't mean as much. People love to cite how in-region matchups are wonky and people develop counters and player-specific metas that don't reflect the overall skill levels of the players involved. A more accurate assessment would be that <strong>locals and nationals require different skillsets</strong>. While we love to think that locals are training grounds to hone our skills for nationals, in many ways, they don't prepare us at all.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Challenges Unique to Nationals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Travel fatigue:</strong> Likely to have fatigue from traveling long distances</li>
                <li><strong>Lost practice time:</strong> You lose out on the possibility of a day of meaningful practice right before the tournament</li>
                <li><strong>No setup access:</strong> You are likely to not have a setup in the room you're staying in</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep disruption:</strong> Beds, snoring roommates, pillows, anxiety, jetlag, etc. can all totally mess up your sleep</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Multi-Day Performance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The scheduling at most nationals necessitates playing well over at least 2 days</li>
                <li>Finding "the zone" where you're playing your best is difficult</li>
                <li>Finding it two days in a row at the exact times you need to play is more than difficult</li>
                <li>This is perhaps the most important challenge of all</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limited Warmup - The Most Important Factor</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>At nationals, especially Evo, you get less warmup</li>
                <li>The ratio of setups to players is not very good at most nationals</li>
                <li>We should all make a point of lauding tournaments where it's actually easy to get friendlies in (particularly with Smashladder being a frequent side event)</li>
                <li>You often stand around for almost half an hour between matches, doing nothing, as all the setups are occupied for tournament matches</li>
                <li>Then you have to sit down and immediately play your best</li>
                <li>If you SD or get shine spiked twice in the first game, that's likely to be the set</li>
                <li><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Put special effort into staying in the zone between games</li>
                <li>Many of us are normally social at tournaments, but at nationals, you might want to save socializing for after your pool is done</li>
                <li>Focus on your upcoming match and what your goals for the day are in terms of execution and gameplan</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Losing in Upper Bracket at Nationals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Losing in the upper bracket at nationals sucks</li>
                <li>At locals, it's often a boon to lose early - you get to line up your opponents, get momentum, and cruise all the way through the tournament</li>
                <li>At nationals, you don't get to line up your opponents the same way</li>
                <li>You still wait a lot - pool waves hours apart and have to play over different days</li>
                <li>You have to play way more matches for the same placing</li>
                <li>You have a crazy high chance of coming across some gimmick, novel playstyle, or playstyle counter for you</li>
                <li>Only the last of which is likely to happen at a local</li>
                <li>And if you make it to the last day in the lower bracket, you're in for a rough time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Morning Performance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Playing well in the morning is hard, especially if it's the day after traveling, when you obviously couldn't practice</li>
                <li>At locals and regionals, you often don't have to play well until the sun is going down - the earlier matches are fluff</li>
                <li>It's incredibly rough when you have to wake up day 2 or day 3 at a national and your first match of the day is against an opponent who's better than you</li>
                <li>A lot of the time these are the most fun people to play - people who you can beat at your best but who will destroy you at your worst</li>
                <li>Often, these players make you rise up to the challenge and make you play your best</li>
                <li>But if it's before noon and you're groggy from messed up sleep, a crazy night before, or just not being a morning person, you're probably just going to get run over</li>
                <li><strong>Find some kind of morning routine to ameliorate this</strong></li>
                <li>Gamers generally are night owls, so if you can learn to play your best in the morning, you'll have a huge advantage</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Advantages of Locals: Endurance and Grinding</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Locals test some completely different skills</li>
                <li>Endurance is a personal strength for some, and an all-day grind which starts with everyone and ends with one final winner is a format where some players thrive</li>
                <li><strong>Example - Redbull G&G:</strong> Lost to a relatively unknown Arcadian quite badly early in the tournament. Played awful. But the tournament reset everyone in the Forsaken Bracket to be in a new bracket with no losses, so didn't need to play very well until 7pm. It wasn't until LR2 in the Forsaken Bracket that play actually started improving. After grinding through a hangover and fatigue with the help of a ton of caffeine, finally found the groove</li>
                <li>Grinding through your subpar play and finding your footing when you need to is unlikely to happen at a national</li>
                <li>Though it's possible if you are trying to get through R2 pools at 6 or 8pm</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Advantages of Locals: Preparation and Familiarity</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It's easier to prepare for brackets at locals</li>
                <li>Nationals release brackets and pools far in advance, but watching videos or asking people what character your opponents play isn't the same</li>
                <li>When you go to locals, you know every relevant player's style, character, and character counterpicks</li>
                <li><strong>Example scenario:</strong> R1 pool WF opponent is a "pretty good Marth." Dumpster him game 1, slack a bit game 2 and let him edge you out on his counterpick, then pick FD game 3. He switches to Falco. Well fuck. No one told you he played Falco. Maybe there are no videos of him playing Falco anywhere. You might just be in the lower bracket for the rest of the tournament</li>
                <li>These situations rarely come up at locals</li>
                <li>You're less likely to come across some gimmick strategy you haven't faced before</li>
                <li>Maybe no one has ever planked against you. Maybe you didn't know Pikachu wrecks your character on FD because you didn't realize how busted his chaingrab is</li>
                <li>These are the kinds of things you'll learn after one exposure at a local</li>
                <li>Eventually the pool of people who rely on such tactics and the potential new things for them to exploit dries up in your region</li>
                <li>At nationals, the odds of someone having some trick to edge out one game is much higher</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Crowd Pressure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Obnoxious crowds are scarcely a problem at locals</li>
                <li>Even if people get rowdy in your region, it's pretty unlikely that someone is going to have their group of 10 friends behind them heckling you</li>
                <li>Ever played against anyone from AZ or Pittsburgh? Ever play in a crew battle? It's hard</li>
                <li>Locals really don't prepare you for the rowdiness and spotlight that come out at nationals</li>
                <li>Someone who's top 20 in the world in a silent venue but not top 100 when getting heckled is not a bad player</li>
                <li>But given the environment at nationals, this is actually a possibility, and in current scene, we might never appreciate that player's skill because we might never see it manifest when the spotlight is there</li>
                <li><strong>If you feel that's you: LISTEN TO MUSIC OR GET AN AUDIO SETUP!</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summary: Different Skillsets</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Nationals require: handling travel fatigue, multi-day consistency, limited warmup, morning performance, dealing with unknowns, crowd pressure</li>
                <li>Locals reward: endurance, grinding through bad play, familiarity with opponents, consistent environment</li>
                <li>Both are valid tests of skill, just different ones</li>
                <li>Prepare specifically for the format you're attending</li>

            <h2>Developing Your Own Style: The Rachman Story - NMW</h2>
            
            <h3>The Tale of Two Falcons</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>At Shine, a Falcon player named Rachman asked for a money match and struck to Yoshi's</li>
                <li>This immediately made NMW happy, as it indicated they wanted to fight instead of camp and fish for DD grabs</li>
                <li>Rachman played a crazy style, slightly reminiscent of n0ne</li>
                <li>It made NMW want to go crazy as well, and Rachman managed to win the match, albeit with half a dozen SDs from trying to go too hard</li>
                <li>They played two more money matches, and by the third one, NMW destroyed him with relative ease without dropping a game</li>
                <li>Less than an hour later, another Falcon player (let's call him Jimmy) asked for a money match</li>
                <li>NMW was excited because of the high from how fun the games against Rachman were</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Contrast</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Playing Jimmy was the complete opposite experience</li>
                <li>He had clearly based his game on 20GX tutorials and had nothing novel or interesting to bring to the table</li>
                <li>At first he did ok, but by the last game, NMW destroyed him badly</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Key Lesson</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You aren't likely to beat someone better than you by doing things they've already seen countless times</strong></li>
                <li>If Jimmy and Rachman were in a bracket and faced a third Falcon player closer to their skill levels, it's likely Jimmy could do just as well as Rachman, possibly better</li>
                <li>But put in a situation where Jimmy was playing against someone who significantly outclassed him... he had no chance</li>
                <li>Jimmy was decent at dash dance grabbing and pretty decent at tech chasing</li>
                <li>But when it came down to it, NMW was just better than him at everything he based his gameplan around</li>
                <li>There was virtually no way for Jimmy to beat someone doing something that he's just worse at</li>
                <li>Rachman, on the other hand, created many situations that made NMW uncomfortable and that he was not as well equipped to handle</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Problem with Copying Top Players</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There are many aspiring Falcon mains and few of them are inspiring</li>
                <li>20GX has made a laudable attempt to show the viability of the character, but now most "decent" Falcon mains play like a pirated Chinese knockoff of Wizzrobe</li>
                <li>Being able to DD grab well is an extremely great thing for an aspiring Falcon, maybe the best possible tool</li>
                <li>But styles predicated on waiting for the other players to make mistakes are awful for upsetting better players</li>
                <li>If your style has been crafted around watching tutorials and emulating top players, you should look long and hard at your own style</li>
                <li>Think about whether you have anything fresh to bring to the table</li>
                <li><strong>You'll never be the best by copying the rest</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Players Who Bring Their Own Flavor</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Even players like Borp, w33dl0rd, Drephen, Iceman, Widlar, and many others, who sometimes look "dumb" when they play, have significant chances to upset players who are notably better than them</li>
                <li>They've created their own flavor of how to play the game which makes their opponents play by different rules</li>
                <li>It's no surprise that n0ne was the first Falcon to beat M2K, and that he did it twice before other Falcons were able to</li>
                <li>Even though Wizzy might be overall better than n0ne, there's no way to practice for playing n0ne</li>
                <li>He's crazy and no one will ever play quite like him</li>
                <li>Playing against Lord might help, but finding a session to practice with that guy is borderline impossible</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Get in the Lab</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hopefully this all motivates some of you to get in the lab and come up with stuff people haven't seen before</li>
                <li>At the very least, practice some things that will lead to significant mental damage and get you momentum in sets</li>
                <li>If you play ANY high tier, there's tons of things you can do in your punish game to put the fear in your opponent and to feel yourself</li>
                <li>Don't be content to always settle for ending things early to set up a ledge guard situation</li>
                <li>Melee players have a strange obsession with "what's optimal" when in reality, what's "optimal" is whatever is going to win you the set</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Rachman vs Zeo Example</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Rachman 4 stocked Zeo in a crew battle at Shine (doesn't seem to have been recorded)</li>
                <li>Zeo would actually probably come out ahead if these guys played several sets</li>
                <li>But in the heat of the moment and playing one game against someone with a style he's never faced, Rachman destroyed him</li>
                <li>This further exemplifies the point about novel styles creating upsets</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Final Takeaway</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cultivate your own style and try to make your opponents play on your terms!</strong></li>
                <li>Innovation and unpredictability can beat superior execution</li>
                <li>Create situations your opponents aren't equipped to handle</li>
                <li>Don't just be a worse version of a top player - be the best version of yourself</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Frame Advantage in Neutral - Druggedfox</h2>
            
            <h3>Redefining the Objective</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Rather than viewing the goal as landing a hit, we can view the game in more general terms: the objective is to gain a significant enough frame advantage that the risk/reward in any given situation is skewed in one's favor</li>
                <li>Each game state in Melee can be fully described by variables of space and time: the positions of the two players, and their relative frame advantage</li>
                <li>When thinking about and analyzing matchups, it's important to think about both how interactions play out given various amounts of frame advantage, as well as how effectively each character can influence frame advantage from a neutral state</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Traditional Frame Advantage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Frame advantage traditionally refers to situations where an opponent either gets hit by or blocks an attack</li>
                <li>Example: Fox uptilt on shield is -11 (opponent is actionable for 11 frames before Fox)</li>
                <li>Example: Peach float canceled aerial at lowest height is +4 on shield (she can act 4 frames before opponent)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Frame Advantage in Neutral</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Every movement option chosen when players are "feeling each other out" is just a marginal risk taken to gauge what sort of advantage can be gained</li>
                <li>Each player is trying to reposition relative to their opponent's actions to give them the highest chance of winning an ensuing interaction</li>
                <li>If it seems like the "timing" of the situation will not be advantageous, there is an attempt to disengage and reestablish favorable positioning</li>
                <li>High level players intuitively act based on feel - they get a read on movement patterns and take instinctive actions that allow them to gain advantage while the other person repositions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example: Falcon Nair vs Sheik Ftilt</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sheik's ftilt hits on frame 5, but the part that will realistically hit Falcon isn't until frame 6</li>
                <li>Falcon's nair hits on frame 7, with 4 frames of jump squat = effectively 10 frame startup (hits on frame 11)</li>
                <li>For Falcon to nair without losing to ftilt, he needs to be "+6" in neutral (11-6 = 5 for a trade)</li>
                <li>If Sheik whiffs an ftilt and Falcon isn't in range to whiff punish with grab, he has still gained frame advantage</li>
                <li>If Falcon can position himself close enough to Sheik after she whiffs ftilt and gets there with at least 6 frames to spare, his nair actually beats the ftilt option</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Gaining Frame Advantage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Baiting out an extremely laggy move (like Marth forward smash) gives you significant frame advantage for a guaranteed hit</li>
                <li>If an opponent will try to wavedash forward and that can be predicted, it changes the nature of potential interactions - a wavedash gives ~14 frames of time to do whatever you want</li>
                <li>Nobody sees the game frame by frame, but the concept of "how much time" we have to execute an action in a situation is intuitive to all of us</li>
                <li>This frame advantage can be achieved through many means, and how much advantage you have determines whether it's a good idea to challenge the opponent in any given situation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Think about the game in terms of space and time: the positions of the two players and their relative frame advantage</li>
                <li>The specifics vary greatly from matchup to matchup and interaction to interaction</li>
                <li>Understanding this concept helps analyze how interactions play out and how effectively each character can influence frame advantage from neutral</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>RPS, Playing Your Game, and Conditioning - NMW</h2>
            
            <h3>The Neutral Game Paradox</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The neutral game in Melee is the part of the game with the most depth and yet it still probably has the least content about it</li>
                <li>While it's easy to describe how matchups fundamentally "should" be played, it can be very hard to implement this knowledge</li>
                <li>At top level, theoretical descriptions are often inaccurate because of RPS, conditioning, and forcing opponents to play your game</li>
                <li>CrimsonBlur does an amazing job articulating how matchups should be played, but why are his descriptions so often inaccurate at top level?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Understanding Weighted RPS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fighting games and most strategy games are ultimately a form of weighted RPS, where different options have different risk/reward ratios</li>
                <li>Things with lower risk or higher rewards are preferable. Things that are virtually risk free will be chosen most often</li>
                <li>Things that have big rewards in Melee tend to be risky (things easier to react to are more risky)</li>
                <li>Because there aren't many high reward options that are low risk, you can usually narrow down the number of high reward options a player might use to a small set (e.g. wavedash fsmash as Marth)</li>
                <li>Unless playing against extremely unpredictable players like w33dl0rd or n0ne, you should be able to keep track of which risky options a player throws out</li>
                <li>High risk options are more often chosen on defense, because defensive situations don't have as many good answers</li>
                <li>Remember these habits and try to play around them in a low risk way. Once you've noted these habits, you can start baiting and punishing them</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Makes Options "Good"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What is good in Melee is mostly a function of risk/reward</li>
                <li>Good things tend to be difficult to react to (low risk) or difficult to punish even when reacted to properly (e.g. Falco's AC bair)</li>
                <li>Some options counter specific options with devastating potency - these might cost you your stock if you miss, but you'll still consider using them if the situation arises</li>
                <li>Example: Fthrowing someone off with Marth or Falco then DJ dairing their sweetspot to the ledge can be low risk AND have huge reward</li>
                <li>That option hard counters a common defensive option which is among the most sound for most of the cast in terms of risk/reward</li>
                <li>Almost every option in the game, no matter how stupid or sound, can be hard countered by something else</li>
                <li>Most of these hard counters are not sound in terms of risk/reward, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do them - you need to know when to do them</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Gimmicks and Situational Knowledge</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Having a bag of gimmicks and knowing when to use them is a legitimate skill</li>
                <li>Finishing a set with a gimmick or "onesie" (as Shroomed calls it) is a fantastic way to close out a tense situation</li>
                <li>Example: Hit shield → bait bair OOS, pivot fsmash or reverse boost. It works a shitton of the time</li>
                <li>If you're insistent on just doing "what's good," you'll struggle against players who know when to use specific tricks</li>
                <li>If your head is up your ass and you're insistent on just doing "what's good," you're going to come across someone like Lord, n0ne, or Laudandus who dicks you and leaves you immensely frustrated</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Case Study: Lord's Bag of Gimmicks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lord is sometimes described as gimmicky, but he's smart, has depth, and is sound in basic fundamentals - yet he IS a gimmicky fuck</li>
                <li>The dude has so many more gimmicks than anyone else - he has a huge bag of tricks</li>
                <li>Example: Hit Shroomed's Sheik off, waveland onto BF side platform, then FH nair and FF immediately, hitting way below the stage. There's no way that should ever work, but he knew in tournament to go for it because he knew it was going to work</li>
                <li>The man knows when to do specific tricks - he reads when to use them in tournament sets</li>
                <li>Lord is way better at RPS situations because he has been in them so many times and has so much experience reading people as they adapt to his options</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Making Opponents Play Your Game - The Lord Example</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>At Genesis 3, Gahtzu lost six stocks before taking one of Lord's</li>
                <li>Lord picks things that he knows beat your options, even though your options are strategically sound</li>
                <li>The fact that he knows they're strategically sound makes it easier for him to read and pick the correct counter</li>
                <li><strong>Example 1:</strong> After hitting shield, many people like to jab. ASDI down grab beats that. Jab Lord's shield and he usually grabs you</li>
                <li><strong>Example 2:</strong> When Lord hits your shield, you think he's gonna jab? Nope, he raptor boosts. Raptor boost is a fucking terrible option after hitting shield, but what does it counter? ASDI down grab spamming. It beats literally no other options</li>
                <li>Even when you know the counters to the counters, he comes out on top in these situations ~70% of the time because it's his strong point</li>
                <li>Force people to play your game and you can win despite a skill disparity</li>
                <li>M2K has made a career out of cheesing people in situations at the ledge where he's at no objective advantage using disparity in situational knowledge and awareness</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conditioning Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you can put people in mixup situations, especially ones you're familiar with that they have to learn on the fly, you're likely to come out ahead</li>
                <li>Example: Lord punishing Flash whenever he tried to get back on stage</li>
                <li>The best way to condition is to do something standard and low risk the first few times a situation comes up, then mix them up later in the set</li>
                <li>Sometimes it may be best to save your mixup for later in the set to trick them at a crucial moment</li>
                <li>There are ambivalent feelings about whether you should not take stocks because you want to save tricks for later</li>
                <li>In some situations, NOT mixing it up can be a really strong mixup - if successful, this tends to get in people's heads and tilt them</li>
                <li>Example: Frootloop is very good at not mixing it up - getting hit by Fox upsmash a bunch of times makes people think "Fox is such bs"</li>
                <li>If the flow of the match calls for it, don't be afraid to go for repetitive strong options</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Theory vs Practice: Marth vs Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>In theory:</strong> Marth should dance around Sheik, using superior ground movement and dtilt to poke because she doesn't want to jump</li>
                <li><strong>In practice (historically):</strong> This matchup came down to Marth's having imperfect maneuvering and getting caught, then getting beat up by Sheik's punish game, which is immensely easier to perform than Marth's</li>
                <li><strong>Going into 2017:</strong> Marth players are finally getting to the level where they can move around and play the match the way it "should" play out</li>
                <li>Marth is getting better at avoiding situations where any mixup can happen against Sheik</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Theory vs Practice: Marth vs Falcon</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>In theory:</strong> Marth should stuff or evade Falcon whenever he tries to throw out a move, and use dtilt to prevent Falcon from playing a one-dimensional move-on-ground-and-fish-for-grabs game</li>
                <li><strong>In theory:</strong> Falcon shouldn't really be able to hit Marth (if you've ever played Tai in the matchup, he plays it the most like this)</li>
                <li><strong>In practice:</strong> Falcon can set up enough RPS situations using CC, raw grab, run up shield, instant upair, and raptor boost so that Marth players can't just play it out the way it "should" go</li>
                <li>If Falcon wins only a few RPS exchanges, or is able to call out Marth movement with a risky approach just a few times, Falcon can still win</li>
                <li>Falcon players are getting better at creating frustrating situations for Marth where you can trick them and get a juicy opening</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Case Constructions (from Luninspectra)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The amount of case constructions you have determines your ability to play against new players comfortably</li>
                <li>You construct cases to mentally minimize the possible actions your opponent can take</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Opponent double-jumps. They can only: 1) Come down with aerial, 2) Firefox/Illusion, 3) Waveland, 4) Land, 5) Airdodge</li>
                <li>Be a statistician and remember what they did when they double-jumped. Remember the primary action (coming down with aerial) and secondary action (wavelanding)</li>
                <li>Minimize it further: They'll either come down with aerial OR waveland. What move counters both? Possibly raptor boost</li>
                <li>Apply the best move for the situation or use it by chance/prediction</li>
                <li>By minimizing actions to 2, your lowest chance to get them is 50% (assuming you do the right moves)</li>
                <li>It would be hard if they did an airdodge to avoid the raptor or knee, because they never did that at all in the match until then</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Frame Advantage Breakdown</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Drill has variable frame advantage depending on which frame you land</li>
                <li>It's difficult to intentionally go for the better frames consistently</li>
                <li><strong>On spacies:</strong> Worst-case frame advantage is 5 frames, best-case is 7 frames</li>
                <li>Since grab hits frame 7, if you're frame-perfect with best-case frame advantage, the grab is guaranteed</li>
                <li>Your timing gets to be more consistent than your opponent's, making it difficult for them to shine quickly enough even if they technically have time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Counterplay & Mixups</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best counterplay for the defender:</strong> Buffered spot dodge - gets out of the way if Fox isn't perfect and doesn't require crazy timing</li>
                <li><strong>Buffered roll is NOT fast enough</strong> - you can charge up smash or dash back and wait out the spot dodge</li>
                <li>Once opponents start buffering spot dodge, you can mix them up with charged upsmash or dash back wait</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Neutral Game Concepts - Zamu</h2>
            
            <h3>Decision Making</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The most important thing for decision making and execution in any given situation in Melee: fully understand it, and it will be easier to look at. Learn each situation over and over again</li>
                <li>Play the RPS and then sprinkle everything else in</li>
                <li>There are other reasons why you should be beating people besides just adapting</li>
                <li>Attempt to always make decisions as humanly late as possible. Ideally every input you do should have been decided 15 frames before you do it. Kind of hard to do perfectly but what you should be aiming to do on a macro level</li>
                <li>Each time you look for a hit ask yourself "did I have the prerequisite advantage to do the thing I did?" and also "did I deserve to get a hit here?" If you ask yourself this and you say no, you probably shouldn't be attacking</li>
                <li>Be more careful about your move choices "does this move lead to a punish?" "does this move get me punished?"</li>
                <li>Choose less "read" options at the beginning of the game - wait like 5 or 10 more frames and dash dance which lets you react to a jump by seeing a short hop nair</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Situational Awareness</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Think more about the potential neutral win</li>
                <li>Don't lump spots together unless they need to be lumped together</li>
                <li>Don't think about how an opponent whiffed a move generally because you can be in so many different places</li>
                <li>Pick your spots to fight - the more you wait to fight the more likely you'll find a good opening</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Positioning & Stage Control</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Make your opponent prove that you have to be the one to approach, but that is never the case because of laser (i.e. Peach, Puff)</li>
                <li>Think more about what are good positions to be in rather than "I have a lead and my opponent needs to approach" or "I'm behind so I need to approach"</li>
                <li>Make your opponent force you to have a reason to approach rather than be pressured by attrition</li>
                <li>Approach when you need to approach and don't approach when you don't need to</li>
                <li>Take account of position and percent</li>
                <li>Practice staying in whiff punish range. Stop making hard reads - they are just straight up bad risk reward. It is basically just a very hopeful guess</li>
                <li>Look for clean neutral wins where if the opponent does something you can punish and if you don't you are still generally in advantage</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Stock & Percent Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stock lead means nothing in the ditto - percents matter a lot. Stock leads only matter if the game goes to time and game never goes to time in Fox dittos</li>
                <li>Percent matters if your opponent is higher than yours because if you just trade hits, you just win the game. Not necessarily what you want to be looking for - you want clean neutral because that situation is independent of the stock lead</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Movement & Spacing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>De-group your full hops (they are not grounded or actionable)</li>
                <li>If your opponent is just existing and you are full hopping you are at a mild disadvantage</li>
                <li>Make sure each full hop is individually fine and that you are not in full hop mode. Have a good reason for each full hop</li>
                <li>No reason to start drill high (unless you do FH drill and it combos on the ground) because you are aiming for your moves to hit and not whiff</li>
                <li>Replace giving up a lot of space to bait the opponent to move forward with aerial dash back or full hop in place</li>
                <li>If you are trying to corner pressure an opponent, give up space but not enough space to stop threatening your opponent</li>
                <li>Focus on using your movement to make the opponent uncomfortable</li>
                <li>To be patient - focus on doing nothing and keeping enough space between you and your opponent but still giving up space to dash dance into</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Patience & Not Attacking</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't attack if they are gonna whiff - the opponent doesn't know if you are doing a move or not, so you don't need to use that move!</li>
                <li>Focus on being actionable (specifically focus on not whiffing attacks that don't need to be whiffed) - stage position pressure</li>
                <li>Remove the spurts in your play where you give up on playing neutral entirely - take a deep breath</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Advantage State</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sometimes it's okay to hold a good position and you don't have to attack. As soon as you do something punishable you are no longer in an advantage state and can die</li>
                <li>As long as I play patient in advantage the risk reward is skewed in my favor</li>
                <li>When you have frame advantage, you know your opponent has to do something because they are in more lag than you are</li>
                <li>Don't bait your opponent - it is a more inconsistent way to play the game rather than just playing the position in a more simple manner</li>
                <li>Wait and screen look because the opponent needs to fight out of the corner regardless</li>
                <li>You are putting yourself in good positions but then you attack out of them and lose out on the value. Work on waiting to capitalize in these spots</li>
                <li>Start getting hit because you are not doing anything. When this happens, the opponent won the neutral game without getting a free hit, which is super duper sick</li>
                <li>Stop giving opponents free hits</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Corner Pressure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You don't have to nair into the corner because the opponent is already incentivized to fight out of the corner</li>
                <li>If the opponent isn't fighting for every 10 decisions, maybe you nair or running shine into the corner, or even pretend to do so - it's the threat that matters</li>
                <li>Figure out 4 options you want to do to corner pressure - be ready to hit him moving out of the corner</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Respawn Invincibility</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you respawn just play neutral - it is literally just Melee neutral but they can't hit you for a couple of seconds. You get to make a clean read in this moment</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How do I not get reversaled?</li>
                <li>How do I take my advantage as far as possible?</li>
                <li>Recognize when your combo is over and when the combo is over</li>
                <li>By playing you either: a) decrease disadvantage or b) find an advantage state</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Punish Game & Combo Extensions - Zamu</h2>
            
            <h3>Combo Theory</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Work on the up air follow up around 40 where the follow-up won't be a grab (could be platform, ledge, shy guys, etc.)</li>
                <li>Learning where to end the combo based on the situational variable - how does this become a kill?</li>
                <li>The correct answer in this case oftentimes is to reset to neutral</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tech Execution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice up throwing Fox onto BF / Stadium / Dreamland platform and doing full hop up air to cover 3/3 tech options</li>
                <li>Practice crouch canceling after whiffed aerials</li>
                <li>Short hop up air is good when the opponent is actionable - otherwise go for the full hop if you don't have time</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Marth Matchup Concepts - Billybopeep</h2>
            
            <h3>Neutral Game vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Marth doesn't have the way to defend himself in the corner like he does in the center</li>
                <li>If you are trying to whiff punish short hop fair range you want to be close enough that the drift does not do anything</li>
                <li>Full hop empty land and check what Marth does - this is faster than aerial and gives you visual time to confirm</li>
                <li>You can't ever hit anything Marth does with full hop unless you are preemptively doing it. This is part of the challenge against Marth in neutral</li>
                <li>Focus on knowing when Marth has to land - the spots that are coming up are spots where Marth has to land on the ground. These are the moments where you need to whiff punish Marth or pressure him</li>
                <li>If you don't have the frames to directly punish him you need to setup for pressure</li>
                <li>Apply aggressive dash back to whiff punish or pressure in these situations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Corner Pressure vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Be more willing to throw out hitboxes in the corner ONCE YOU HAVE MARTH IN THE ZONE NEAR THE INNER LIP</li>
                <li>The difference between Marth and Falco in the corner is that you can't get away with walling pressure - you have to pick a move sometimes and dash out</li>
                <li>As soon as you see Marth do a normal, the opportunity to whiff punish that is already over. Internalize that you need to read Marth doing something to hit him or change gears to pressure or position</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Movement vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Full hop drift neutral or drift away at Marth - never drift at Marth. If you do he will ALWAYS get away first and the moves he has are too fast + dash back</li>
                <li>If you are close enough to Marth and he doesn't know what's happening, if Marth is dashing toward you while you are dashing back it is not great because the decision tree becomes much more complicated</li>
                <li>What makes dash back offensively good: when Marth is in Fox's threat range he is constantly in a place where you can't react to Fox's aerials. It sets up the time so if Marth tries to stop you offensively you will be ready to hit him for it</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Punish Game vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Recognize when you have a meaningful hit, but not a direct combo, and what mixup needs to be played accordingly. Super important concept for fighting Marth</li>
                <li>If you are not sure if your shine will connect cleanly or at all, waveshine down</li>
                <li>On missed tech against Marth think about up tilt and short hop up air off of a knockdown</li>
                <li>DO NOT full hop falling bair - it does NOTHING against Marth EVER</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recovery vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If Marth is close to edge in a way where the up-B curls under the stage, you want to double jump back to refresh instead of Firefox</li>
                <li>Vertically far away = DJ back to refresh to cover yourself</li>
                <li>Horizontally far away = DJ in place to refresh to cover yourself</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tether Theory</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The tether is that if you are really far away from Marth you have to get close to Marth. You are either directly in front of Marth, or completely out of the range</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Laser Usage vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you are going to laser, stop picking offensive option after - it's detrimental</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Floaty Mid-Tier Concepts - Billybopeep</h2>
            
            <h3>Understanding Mid-Tier Characters</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mid tiers - they have less relevant options. Sit down and map out their real options</li>
                <li>You can teach someone how to approach a mid tier matchup in an hour - look at every move they have, what does the character's kit make their goals?</li>
                <li>Stop overgeneralizing - fight DK by knowing his linear neutral. You can just wait and laser and then do things that make it hard to interact. DK close range doesn't get much off of anything when facing forward</li>
                <li>X character has Y weakness and therefore because of X character and Y weakness I must play Z way</li>
                <li>Make generalizations that allow you to perceive the information correctly - the generalizations are not the answers themselves but instead the path to the answers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Character Weakness Analysis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Luigi's main weakness is that he doesn't have horizontal drift, which means that the angles he can approach from are limited. As Fox with unlimited movement, you can outmaneuver the Luigi player. The thought process is outmaneuvering Luigi by making it hard to find approach options</li>
                <li>Is there a way that I can decide to engage with this character? If so, how? If not, how do I minimize the engagement rate?</li>
                <li>Mid tiers are mid tiers because they are more vulnerable, and you can force situations where engagement is impossible</li>
                <li>You can simply run away, and sometimes they are unable to stop you because of their kit</li>
                <li>Picking proper engagement points is a key driving principle in theory for beating mid tier characters</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Neutral Strategy vs Mid-Tiers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay in slight advantage until you find a spot to engage in</li>
                <li>Respect the floaty mid tier kit - but don't respect the non-functional moves</li>
                <li>Know what is and isn't good in their kit and exploit them for doing the bad things</li>
                <li>Understand the character dynamic. Figure out the character weakness and engage with them properly (which implies correct timing)</li>
                <li>Do a variety of things - and don't do the same thing. Neutral is actually what is difficult for these characters, therefore once you do the same thing and they catch on they can do the thing where they potentially hit you really hard which is what makes them a mid tier and not a low tier</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Defense & Shield Game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Know what is and isn't shield grabbable. Understand inherent qualities of moves and their various applications (Fox nair, Falco shine, Marth nair, Sheik fair when L-canceled)</li>
                <li>Setup options in training mode and check if it's safe</li>
                <li>Understand what characters can do after a hit on shield. Sometimes you can just press the A button instead of shine OOS</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Punish Game vs Mid-Tiers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Figure out where the mid tier has no options and follow up and abuse punishes as a result of knowing that character can't do anything when you counter-hit</li>
                <li>They have to work really hard to do anything when you engage with their weaknesses directly</li>
                <li>Whiff landing lag of back air against Donkey Kong - this character doesn't have X option which makes Y option more reasonable</li>
                <li>Another example could be Samus down smash having way more lag than initially appears</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice Drills</h3>
            <ul>

            <h3>Combo Enders</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If your combo ender is an up air, and it doesn't kill, it usually is the wrong combo ender - consider up throw bair when you would normally try to finish the combo</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Kill Confirms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Work on hard DI away JC up smash kill confirms around 100%</li>

            <h3>Dash Back Framework</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your dash back is used to look and check and then you can use prediction confirmation off of the look and check</li>
                <li>This is all range dependent and will only work if both of you are inside each other's threat range</li>
                <li>Get better at whiff punishing - and get them to whiff using your movement - use the dash back look and check framework</li>
                <li>If you are actually close enough to threaten each other - that is the range where you can whiff punish</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Uncertainty & Panic Situations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When there is some uncertainty in these panic situations - wait for panic double jump bair and feel it out, then stand still and dash back and grab</li>
                <li>If you are uncertain of what your opponent is going to do, you should consider waiting until the last possible second you think you could get hit and then dash back and looking for a dash dance grab if you don't know what exactly they want</li>

            <ul>
                <li>If you are extremely late on a tech chase - recognize that you are playing a mixup and use your space well accordingly</li>
                <li>You can bait him into attacking you - or nair him in the face</li>

            <h3>Recovery Timing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You have time to refresh when they are below the stage in the start of a Firefox - pay attention to the refresh</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Anti-Reversal Coverage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Turn around and back air if you think they are going to try to reversal you with a landing aerial</li>
                <li>You either get the chance to kill them for the double jump aerial or you are wrong and they go to ledge and they have to play out of disadvantage anyways</li>
                <li>To do this: do a late bair and drift away - do this really late and it will be really hard for them to hit you with the Firefox</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Chem's Fox Edgeguard Flowchart</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Do shine to cover the angle to ledge - this covers almost any angle that goes to ledge</li>
                <li>Any angle that DOESN'T go to ledge (bar a specific high angle) should cover the other options besides the ledge</li>
                <li>If they go high enough to the point where the bair from the shine back air whiffs, then you do another bair from the stage</li>

            <h2>Sheik Matchup - Zamu</h2>
            
            <h3>Combo Game vs Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>On full DI, you can combo with full hop but with no DI you have to do double jump up air</li>
                <li>Your biggest combos are from getting under Sheik and keeping her above you with up air and bair</li>
                <li>Double jump back bair on no invincibility Sheik back air</li>
                <li>Don't look for short hop up air on opponents above the platform because you are way farther than you would be when you land on the platform where you would be closer for more damage</li>
                <li>Practice reading Sheik jump with double jump up air</li>
                <li>How to hit a second hit up air - hit the highest possible point</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Up Throw Combos & DI Mixups</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mixup your drift on up throw up air - drift in the same way as the SDI you are expecting them to do</li>
                <li>Practice up throw up air with act out of wait (right now you are doing 4 frame DJ when it needs to be way faster)</li>
                <li>Build your intuition around how to do a combo - these are the kinds of things where if you have a full understanding of how you want to execute these things so it is not a question for you</li>
                <li>Given the variables, you know that you will not be able to hit something a certain way</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tech Chasing Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice full hop on frame 37 on Sheik to cover missed tech</li>
                <li>Up throw Sheik and then full hop falling up air which covers missed tech and a grab on the rolls. DON'T RUN ALL THE WAY TO THE CORNER ON THE ROLLS</li>
                <li>Practice teching down tilt and f tilt while being tech chased and scraps at higher percents. This will get you more mileage in scraps and disadvantage to get out of the bad situation sooner</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Edgeguarding Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>GRAB LEDGE AFTER HITTING SHEIK OFFSTAGE MORE OFTEN</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Platform Play vs Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Abuse CC on the platform</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Neutral & Decision Making vs Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Look for late nair</li>
                <li>Be more certain of what you want after landing</li>
                <li>Work on not rushing recoveries</li>
                <li>If it was not possible for you to get reversaled no matter what, what would you want?</li>
                <li>Be very specific with each action placed</li>
                <li>Do drop down shine because you want the shine to hit, not because you want to turn around</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mindset vs Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To maintain patience, think about what you know not to do</li>
            </ul>
