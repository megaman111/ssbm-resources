            <h2>General Improvement & Mindset - Zamu</h2>
            
            <h3>Approach to Practice</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Play as if the opponent is the best at their respective character. You don't have to go up from there</li>
                <li>There's merit in beating players the same way versus playing better people. It won't help you beat Zain if you don't treat a worse Marth like Zain</li>
                <li>The goal isn't to beat your opponent but rather is to get better at the matchup</li>
                <li>If you are playing someone over and over and you are beating them the same way, stop playing that interaction - test them somewhere else</li>
                <li>Don't try to work on everything all at once. Pick very specific things, and call yourself out if you see yourself stopping doing that</li>
                <li>Play shorter sessions to be more intentional</li>
                <li>When Zamu plays someone way worse than her she does a lot worse, she'll do way better against the good player because she's not trying to outplay the worse opponent</li>
                <li>If your neutral game is strong it doesn't matter if you open them a lot. If you call them out and they are afraid of you, that's what matters</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Analysis & VOD Review</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you do analysis of your own VODs, look for where you miss kills and where you get killed</li>
                <li>Practice where you miss kills and get killed. These are the fast track options to getting really good</li>
                <li>Make a Google Drive notes for each character - what do I need to work on against this character?</li>
                <li>Be aware of the punish game that is about to occur but don't queue up an action. If you recognize you are late, play an action after</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice Methodology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice specific follow ups → take into account percent, position and DI. Don't get distracted!</li>
                <li>Use custom DI feature in UnclePunch!</li>
                <li>Start more with watching top players</li>
                <li>Make sure your success rate on follow-ups for the meaningful really hard things is high</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Practice Process</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Start off by doing the thing in the easiest way (i.e. waveshine upsmash on Sheik)</li>
                <li>Then move on to doing it from a standing shine</li>
                <li>Then space it farther back</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Practice Drills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice up throw up smash no DI tech chase and make sure to tech chase</li>
                <li>Practice with claw, and without claw for different situations, especially for tech chasing</li>
                <li>Practice waveshine upsmash on Peach, Falcon, Sheik, Marth</li>
                <li>Up throw up air on Puff</li>
                <li>Practice aerial dash back because otherwise aerial shine / aerial isn't on your opponent's mental stack</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The 5 Steps to Getting Good - NMW</h2>
            
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Plateaus exist at all levels of play - it's usually a lack of knowledge about how to practice intelligently, not lack of practice itself</li>
                <li>The optimal way to improve is to learn things in an order based on both ease and usefulness</li>
                <li>As you start to master one step, you'll slowly shift focus to the next until everything from previous steps is subconscious</li>
                <li>Muscle memory is essential for getting SHFFLs down, but autopilot is the enemy of mindful improvement</li>
                <li>You should continually evaluate your habits at every step - old habits die hard</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 1: Tech Skill</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with short hops, SHFFLs, and wavedashes</li>
                <li>Move on to character-specific technology (Up+B OOS for Samus, reverse lasers for Falco, pivots for Falcon, etc.)</li>
                <li>This phase is about learning basic tech skill, not truly difficult stuff like haxdashes</li>
                <li>Mastering a technique in solo practice is only the first step - then you have to learn to do it under pressure, then learn how to apply it</li>
                <li>Application is generally learned by spamming it and figuring out which situations it's useful in through trial and error</li>
                <li>Don't expect to master this in less than a few months - experienced players forget how hard it is to have control when starting out</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Punish Game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Though neutral game is arguably more important, punish game is easier to focus on</li>
                <li>Punish game, like tech skill, is largely contingent on your own execution and not on interaction with the opponent</li>
                <li>Master your own hitboxes, learn your frame data, and learn to be precise with your character</li>
                <li>This is when good players can most easily give good advice - solicit it as soon as your tech skill is solid</li>
                <li>Most people plateau during this phase because they don't give it adequate focus</li>
                <li>Improving control and punish game is one of the easiest and most gratifying ways to improve</li>
                <li>Your first year or two is best spent learning to have perfect control over your own character</li>
                <li>Your own style will start to emerge during this step</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: DI</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>DI takes focus on the opponent - you have to watch them, not yourself</li>
                <li>Really, if you're a competent player, you should be watching your opponent all the time and never focusing on yourself</li>
                <li>This takes too much concentration for a new player - focusing on it sooner will impede improvement of other things</li>
                <li>After you start to notice and understand DI, this will help expand your repertoire of punishes</li>
                <li>New players go for killing moves in the first possible setup. Experienced players do autocombos or bread and butter extensions. Great players trick opponents' DI to artificially extend combos</li>
                <li>As you learn to watch your opponent and not yourself, you'll start to gain insight into neutral game (though this knowledge may be subconscious)</li>
                <li>To have good DI, you need to understand when your opponent wants to attack</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Neutral Game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This is when you're actually starting to play Melee in a way comparable to respected players</li>
                <li>Learn everything about every character: ranges, recovery options, frame data, positional weaknesses, etc.</li>
                <li>Time to start theorycrafting and truly understand the utility of all your options</li>
                <li>Learn to analyze videos - understand why players choose to do what they do, not just admire combos</li>
                <li>Watch videos with analysis by top players and make sure you understand everything they say</li>
                <li>You'll get hype over things you didn't notice before, and things you got hype over before will seem standard</li>
                <li>The beauty of the game doesn't really shine through until you're at this stage</li>
                <li>Stage control and momentum of the match will start to make sense</li>
                <li>After hearing "rolling is bad" for years, this is when you finally have enough situational understanding to bait and punish them</li>
                <li>Once you understand the options a character has, the brilliance behind top players' decisions becomes clear</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 5: Innovation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You've watched many videos and understand your own limitations</li>
                <li>You're making few bad decisions, and when you do, you either understand and regret it or solicit advice</li>
                <li>You've been expanding your bag of tricks since step 2 - movement options are now clear in their application</li>
                <li>You don't drop combos anymore and have all the expected skills of a competitive player</li>
                <li>Your own style will have started to emerge in step 2, but this is where you harness your strengths and search for small optimizations</li>
                <li>As an aspiring player, you won't beat people better than you just by copying what they do - this is that last 10%</li>
                <li>Polish everything and incorporate every new thing you can. Deign to have truly difficult tech skill as consistent as easy tech skill</li>
                <li>Make sure the most useful things are the things you dedicate the most time to be consistent with</li>
                <li>Until you're in step 4, you aren't really in a position to innovate - you need deep understanding of positioning and situations to implement new things</li>
                <li>Step 5 helps you break plateaus in step 4 - it's how you get new options out of sticky situations and trick people with unexpected options</li>
                <li>In a close tournament set, if you use something once and it gets you one kill, it was worthwhile</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Important Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Steps 4 and 5 are the most blurred in their lines - no one ever truly masters neutral game because it isn't truly masterable</li>
                <li>If you practice mindfully, your rate of improvement should generally increase as you get better</li>
                <li>Learning matchups is terribly difficult if you're still in step 2, but you'll pick them up rapidly if you're in step 5</li>
                <li>With the right partner, a matchup could go from being one of your worst to one of your best in a day</li>
                <li>Most players face plateaus because they don't have direction - use available resources to direct your practice</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Teams as a Learning Tool</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For fun and growth, learning teams should happen during steps 2 and 3</li>
                <li>If you can precisely place attacks, you can play teams. DI is easier in teams because holding in is good most of the time</li>
                <li>Rolling and bad tech habits are less problematic in teams</li>
                <li>You'll get more out of playing continuously than losing every game in a four-man rotation</li>
                <li>The intricate dance of the singles neutral game can be entirely circumvented - all you need is to play your role</li>
                <li>As a low level player, your chances of beating good players is immensely higher in teams than in singles</li>
                <li>Though the skillset is different in doubles, it's much easier to do your role and be a good teams player than to learn the subtleties of singles neutral game</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Practice Effectively - NMW</h2>
            
            <h3>The Problem with "Fake It Till You Make It"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Coming from RTS, people often hear they should blindly copy top players until they understand them</li>
                <li>This is awful advice in Melee - doing things you don't understand the purpose behind is terrible</li>
                <li>Your hands should never move faster than your brain, unless you're one of the 1% of people like n0ne or Mango who are actually good at playing solely on feel</li>
                <li>Emulating players without understanding why they do things will stifle your improvement</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice Useful Things</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It can be difficult as a newer player to recognize what's useful and what isn't</li>
                <li>If you aren't at least an upper-mid level player, it's unlikely that any of your ideas for next level tech are useful</li>
                <li>If struggling to find useful things to practice, look at the paragons of your character - Leffen, Wizzrobe, Plup, etc.</li>
                <li>Though no one has a maxed out toolkit, watching optimal/standard players should give you plenty to practice</li>
                <li>If you've practiced something to the point you can execute it, but after a month you still can't integrate it into gameplay, it might be time to abandon that idea</li>
                <li>Not every technique needs to fit into your style - you'll probably learn something during attempted implementation even if unsuccessful</li>
                <li>Ledge play is something most people with most characters could spend a lot of time polishing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For Newcomers: The Color Overlay</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The single best thing you could do to improve is to get 20XX and turn on the color overlay for wait state and missed L-cancels</li>
                <li>Get rid of all your idle frames - this will make the most difference out the gate</li>
                <li>The color overlay does not work when you're airborne or in IASA frames, so don't neglect your fastfalls or movement out of grounded moves</li>
                <li>The two most important things for being good at Melee are movement and knowledge of situations</li>
                <li>Movement you can grind out and rapidly improve at</li>
                <li>Knowledge of situations comes through experience and having an active mind, both in the game and between sessions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Playing vs Practicing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Playing Melee is not necessarily practicing Melee</li>
                <li>Your brain should be fully engaged and you should have several things in mind you want to practice going into every session</li>
                <li>Your skill level and your partner's skill level should directly influence what you practice</li>
                <li>If you are still new, practice tech skill, DI, and punish game</li>
                <li>At any level, there's still punish mixups and tech skill to work on - the worse your opponent is, the more you should focus on these things</li>
                <li>If you're a mid level player against another mid level player or better, neutral game will probably occupy a large portion of your cognitive load</li>
                <li>Improving neutral game is harder to dedicate focus to within a practice regiment - you'll do much of your learning implicitly</li>
                <li>If playing fuck around games, don't dedicate more than half your focus to neutral</li>
                <li>Neutral game is best practiced when at peak focus against better players who are actively trying to counter you</li>
                <li>If you aren't really in the zone, focus on practicing punish game and technical techniques - these areas translate most readily into glaring improvements</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Punish Game Against Different Skill Levels</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Even if your punish game is good, it might not be good against someone with better defense than your common opponents</li>
                <li>Punish and offensive mixups are likely to work on bad players but may not work on better ones</li>
                <li>Work on recognizing situations and execution, but don't get it worked into muscle memory to indiscriminately cover certain scrubby things</li>
                <li>Better players navigate defensive situations much better than nooby friends</li>
                <li>Examples: recovering when off stage, getting out of the corner, moving out of shield (especially after a late aerial on shield)</li>
                <li>Always be diligent in thinking about how someone might escape and what options might cover their escape</li>
                <li>Your friends may not have good SDI, but top players do - develop ideas for how to cover options against better players</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Avoiding Practice Partner Metagames</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Part of getting the most out of practice is recognizing which practice on your opponent will generalize to other players</li>
                <li>The fewer practice partners you have, the more you will develop metagames just to beat them, which may even harm you when you play someone else</li>
                <li>Example: If you only practice against a Sheik who likes to run at you and fight, you might be very good against them but very bad against Sheik in general</li>
                <li>If only exposed to a style where your opponent runs at you, you'll have no idea how to deal with planking, platform camping, standing in corner and throwing needles, etc.</li>
                <li>When people say "x is so good at a matchup because they practice with y," this is almost always bullshit - they're just good at the player matchup</li>
                <li>No one plays every style of a character</li>
                <li>Overstating the relevance of character matchups and understating the value of style vs style or player vs player matchups is among the most common fallacies in our scene</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Categorizing Practice by Opponent Skill Level</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The order of categories here correlate to the skill level of your opponent - focus entirely on the first categories if your opponents are bad, and work your way up as the quality of your opponents increases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Things useful against everyone:</strong> Spacing moves at their tip, grabbing the ledge quickly, ledgedashing</li>
                <li><strong>Guaranteed punishes:</strong> Bear in mind that things that feel guaranteed against your friends may not actually be guaranteed</li>
                <li><strong>Things that are generally good:</strong> Avoid spamming gimmicks as that will inevitably stifle improvement. There's a big difference between things that work and things that are good. Good is mostly a function of risk/reward - good things should be hard to punish, or they should have extremely high reward based on a correct and not outlandish read. Cover as many options as safely as possible, or cover an option with extreme potency</li>
                <li><strong>Ways to trick your opponent:</strong> Actual mindgames and trickery are unlikely to be relevant until a higher level. At lower levels you can just wait for someone to do something stupid. Even if they don't do stupid things, you might struggle to trick someone because they lack situational understanding - someone might be too stupid to roll or spotdodge because they don't understand they're pressured</li>
                <li><strong>If playing someone much better than you:</strong> Put extensive focus on getting out of bad situations by doing things like good SDI, crisp wavedashes out of shield, Amsah techs, etc. This builds situational awareness</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>People suck at getting good at games for innumerable reasons</li>
                <li>This guide assumes you have regular access to practice partners that aren't complete noobs and that you don't lack proper motivation</li>
                <li>Mentality problems are a common reason for stifled improvement</li>
                <li>Despite the fact that you can improve at Melee in infinitely many ways, eliminating idle frames and improving movement will make the most difference early on</li>

            <h2>How to Think About Neutral Game - NMW</h2>
            
            <h3>The Problem: People Don't Use Their Brain</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>People are not proficient at using their brain while playing</li>
                <li>Things that seem obvious or self-evident to some are not intuitive to others</li>
                <li>Some of the best players are unable to articulate even basic things about how they play and why they do what they do</li>
                <li>If you don't feel like you're playing with an intuitive understanding of what's going on, you need to exercise your critical thinking skills</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Most Important Skills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Most important:</strong> Understanding situations</li>
                <li><strong>Second most important:</strong> Movement</li>
                <li>People know to grind movement, but without knowledge of how to apply your movement, you probably won't be able to get ranked in any remotely competitive region</li>
                <li>Dr. PP once pointed out that many players are really good at looking cool between stocks but have no idea how to apply it in their play - don't let this be you</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Case Study: Lord (Falcon)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lord has great tech skill, but it's nothing crazy and he doesn't do much next level stuff in terms of movement</li>
                <li>He probably moves less than any other top Falcon ever has</li>
                <li>The only thing he really has over other Falcons is choosing the right choices in microsituations (which goes hand in hand with his excellent use of crouch cancel)</li>
                <li>He's sometimes able to win sets against top players just by reaching deep into his bag of gimmicks and repeatedly tricking them in a few situations he has a better understanding of</li>
                <li>He spams all kinds of unsafe things that can be countered, but he's good at reading you and knows janky options that beat all the conventional ones</li>
                <li>This demonstrates that situational understanding can overcome technical deficiencies</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Active Thinking During Play</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You should be continually thinking about what your opponent is doing and how to counter it</li>
                <li>If you aren't picking options that specifically counter things you think your opponent is going to do, you are either being wishful that your opponent is bad or you are Hax$</li>
                <li>When you get hit, ask yourself why</li>
                <li>Try to come up with answers for the situation in which you got hit, or try to figure out how to avoid the situation altogether</li>
                <li>Don't be afraid to solicit advice from better players - Melee nerds love talking about Melee</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Weighted Rock Paper Scissors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ultimately, fighting games are all games of weighted rock paper scissors</li>
                <li>Certain options beat certain options but the risk/reward is skewed</li>
                <li>Don't be afraid to throw something out that's high risk if you have a strong reason to believe it's going to beat what they are going to do</li>
                <li>It's very rare to find someone whose actions are totally unpredictable</li>
                <li>Look for situations where you can take advantage of the habits of the opponent</li>
                <li>Look to avoid doing any defensive things because of autopilot</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Key Question</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If someone asks you "what does that option beat?" you should have an answer related to what you have been seeing your opponent doing</li>
                <li>Every option you choose should be intentional and based on what you expect your opponent to do</li>
                <li>This applies to all aspects of the game, but is especially relevant to ledgeguarding, which is frequently one of the areas that could use the most improvement in players' skillsets</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Movement without situational understanding is useless</li>
                <li>Always be thinking about why you're choosing each option</li>
                <li>Study your opponent's habits and exploit them</li>
                <li>Don't autopilot - every decision should be deliberate</li>
                <li>When in doubt, ask better players for advice</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Counterintuitive Things in Melee - NMW</h2>
            
            <h3>Practicing for Hours Doesn't Make You Perfect</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practicing something for hours on end does not make you perfect at it</li>
                <li>When practicing for extensive periods, you get in a groove that you will never be in at a tournament</li>
                <li>Stimulus conditions vary greatly - you will never be in that same mental state at a tournament</li>
                <li>You will be focused on playing your opponent, not on ledgedashing</li>
                <li>Doing things in tournament is different than in your room - you aren't going to get nervous and choke in your room</li>
                <li><strong>Best practice method:</strong> Practice things frequently in short bursts, for ~10 minutes a day, or 10 minutes a few different times in a day</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Copying the Best Players Doesn't Make You One of Them</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In other games, you can fake it until you make it - emulate top players and let understanding follow as execution improves</li>
                <li>This does not work well in Melee</li>
                <li>Even if you think you are copying top players, what they are doing is probably different from what you are doing</li>
                <li>They have extensive understanding of situations and their opponent's mental state</li>
                <li>If you try to do what Norwalk players do, you are probably just going to look stupid</li>
                <li>If you are still bent on copying top players, pick ones that play standard, optimal styles, e.g. Wizzrobe</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Striking to Bad Stages Can Be Good</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If your opponent has 2 counterpicks in a BO3 and you are confident he will pick the one you don't ban, consider starting on that stage</li>
                <li>Often, the way you play on bad counterpicks doesn't say much about your overall strategy</li>
                <li>You might learn your opponent better there than he can learn you</li>
                <li>You also might prefer losing game 1 and having a winnable game 3 over having to play on their best CP game 3</li>
                <li>Similar logic can apply to BO5</li>
                <li>You can still opt to strike to something more neutral in any case, but don't neglect the possibility of striking to a bad stage if you're going to have to play on it later in the set anyway</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Longer Dashes Aren't Always Better</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Having a character that can crouch out of run quickly offers them options that characters with longer dashes don't have</li>
                <li>Cactuar dash offers a similar movement option to dash dance for these characters</li>
                <li>It lets you implement crouching into your movement very nicely</li>
                <li>Even if your character has a long dash, be sure to work on dash dancing different lengths</li>
                <li>Sometimes a good tight dash dance can be indispensable</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sometimes It's Better to Not Hit Someone; Sometimes Getting Hit Is Good</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>In doubles:</strong> Hitting someone out of the corner with a move that doesn't hit them far off the other side of the stage can be really bad - sometimes hitting someone lets their team regain stage position</li>
                <li><strong>In singles:</strong> Sometimes hitting people ends up with you in a worse position as well</li>
                <li>You can go off with a weak knee, then let your opponent recover before you</li>
                <li>Sometimes hitting people lets them DI and slide to the ledge, so it might have been better to do something like let their shield decay more instead of going for the poke</li>
                <li>Not all openings are equal - be calculated about how you want to hit someone</li>
                <li>Crouch canceling really comes into play here, because sometimes the person who lands the first hit can immediately be punished, even if they try to do it safely</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Guaranteed Followups Can Be Worse Than Non-Guaranteed Ones</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Opportunities are fleeting in Melee</li>
                <li>Sometimes you have reads and you can be confident that you are correct</li>
                <li>In these situations, going for what's guaranteed can be squandering an opportunity that you might not get again</li>
                <li>If you always go for a regrab, you are giving your opponents extra chances to DI to safety</li>
                <li>Seize opportunities when they are there, and end your opponent's stocks when given the chance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Not Approaching Can Be Good Even When You're Losing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Melee has 8 minutes on the clock</li>
                <li>Taking 1-2 minutes off by forcing the game to be played at your pace can be extremely helpful</li>
                <li>By slowing the game down, you can make the opponent play at your pace, not theirs</li>
                <li>Most people get frustrated and approach</li>
                <li>Unless your opponent is actually going to wait out the clock (very few players are disciplined enough to not get cheesed by this), you can get away with camping when you're losing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Doing Things That "Should Never Work" Can Be Super Good</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Top players, especially ones from WC like Shroomed, S2J, Mango, and Lord do all kinds of things that "shouldn't" work</li>
                <li>But they read their opponent, sensing either their habits in game or their mental state outside of the game, and know they can get away with things</li>
                <li>You can even condition your opponents to expect something standard and sensible, then flip the situation on its head by doing something really stupid that they don't expect</li>
                <li>This works really well if you can sense that your opponent is nervous or choking</li>
                <li>You can actually read that someone is choking or that they are going to flub an input</li>
                <li>Sometimes doing something that "shouldn't work" leads to the best possible outcome</li>
                <li>If you are unwilling to do things because they shouldn't work against some TAS bot, you are squandering opportunities</li>
                <li>No Melee player is perfect - look for the imperfections of your opponent and take advantage</li>
                <li><strong>Warning:</strong> Don't do this habitually when playing friendlies against noobs because then you'll develop numerous bad habits</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sometimes Doing Moves Extremely Slowly Is Good</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Delaying moves to the last possible frames often looks stupid, but if you get good at it, the rewards will be huge</li>
                <li>People have timing windows where they expect their opponents to throw out their moves</li>
                <li>This is only natural because things like dash dances and jumps have a rhythm to them</li>
                <li>Play outside the conventional rhythm and you can make people look stupid</li>
                <li>They end up getting caught or baited by unexpected timings</li>
                <li>Even something as stupid as missing the dash dance or "Gould dashing" can lead to a timing mixup, where something that looks retarded ends up getting rewarded</li>
                <li>If you are skeptical about this point or the previous one, just remember that Mattdotzeb beat Leffen</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Not All Kills Are Equal - Emotional Damage Is Real</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Emotional damage is a thing - you can cause people to crumble by ending their stocks in painful ways</li>
                <li>The mental game is a thing, and you can gain mental advantages by devastating opponents in unexpected ways</li>
                <li>Have you ever seen someone SD and then fall apart right after that?</li>
                <li>Or how about that time Darkrain phantomed his kill move, then was unable to regain any footing for the rest of the match?</li>
                <li>It's possible to intentionally cause these decisive moments in the match</li>
                <li>If you see a way to get a particularly humiliating kill, or a chance to kill your opponent in a way he may have never seen before, go for it</li>
                <li>Getting into your opponent's head is a serious advantage</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-section">
            <h2>Frame Advantage in Neutral - Druggedfox</h2>
            
            <h3>Redefining the Objective</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Rather than viewing the goal as landing a hit, we can view the game in more general terms: the objective is to gain a significant enough frame advantage that the risk/reward in any given situation is skewed in one's favor</li>
                <li>Each game state in Melee can be fully described by variables of space and time: the positions of the two players, and their relative frame advantage</li>
                <li>When thinking about and analyzing matchups, it's important to think about both how interactions play out given various amounts of frame advantage, as well as how effectively each character can influence frame advantage from a neutral state</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Traditional Frame Advantage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Frame advantage traditionally refers to situations where an opponent either gets hit by or blocks an attack</li>
                <li>Example: Fox uptilt on shield is -11 (opponent is actionable for 11 frames before Fox)</li>
                <li>Example: Peach float canceled aerial at lowest height is +4 on shield (she can act 4 frames before opponent)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Frame Advantage in Neutral</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Every movement option chosen when players are "feeling each other out" is just a marginal risk taken to gauge what sort of advantage can be gained</li>
                <li>Each player is trying to reposition relative to their opponent's actions to give them the highest chance of winning an ensuing interaction</li>
                <li>If it seems like the "timing" of the situation will not be advantageous, there is an attempt to disengage and reestablish favorable positioning</li>
                <li>High level players intuitively act based on feel - they get a read on movement patterns and take instinctive actions that allow them to gain advantage while the other person repositions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example: Falcon Nair vs Sheik Ftilt</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sheik's ftilt hits on frame 5, but the part that will realistically hit Falcon isn't until frame 6</li>
                <li>Falcon's nair hits on frame 7, with 4 frames of jump squat = effectively 10 frame startup (hits on frame 11)</li>
                <li>For Falcon to nair without losing to ftilt, he needs to be "+6" in neutral (11-6 = 5 for a trade)</li>
                <li>If Sheik whiffs an ftilt and Falcon isn't in range to whiff punish with grab, he has still gained frame advantage</li>
                <li>If Falcon can position himself close enough to Sheik after she whiffs ftilt and gets there with at least 6 frames to spare, his nair actually beats the ftilt option</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Gaining Frame Advantage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Baiting out an extremely laggy move (like Marth forward smash) gives you significant frame advantage for a guaranteed hit</li>
                <li>If an opponent will try to wavedash forward and that can be predicted, it changes the nature of potential interactions - a wavedash gives ~14 frames of time to do whatever you want</li>
                <li>Nobody sees the game frame by frame, but the concept of "how much time" we have to execute an action in a situation is intuitive to all of us</li>
                <li>This frame advantage can be achieved through many means, and how much advantage you have determines whether it's a good idea to challenge the opponent in any given situation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Think about the game in terms of space and time: the positions of the two players and their relative frame advantage</li>
                <li>The specifics vary greatly from matchup to matchup and interaction to interaction</li>
                <li>Understanding this concept helps analyze how interactions play out and how effectively each character can influence frame advantage from neutral</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>RPS, Playing Your Game, and Conditioning - NMW</h2>
            
            <h3>Understanding Weighted RPS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fighting games and most strategy games are ultimately a form of weighted RPS, where different options have different risk/reward ratios</li>
                <li>Things with lower risk or higher rewards are preferable. Things that are virtually risk free will be chosen most often</li>
                <li>Things that have big rewards in Melee tend to be risky (things easier to react to are more risky)</li>
                <li>Because there aren't many high reward options that are low risk, you can usually narrow down the number of high reward options a player might use to a small set</li>
                <li>Unless playing against extremely unpredictable players, you should be able to keep track of which risky options a player throws out</li>
                <li>High risk options are more often chosen on defense, because defensive situations don't have as many good answers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Makes Options "Good"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Good things tend to be difficult to react to (low risk) or difficult to punish even when reacted to properly</li>
                <li>Some options counter specific options with devastating potency - these might cost you your stock if you miss, but you'll still consider using them if the situation arises</li>
                <li>Some options can be low risk AND have huge reward, but there aren't many like this</li>
                <li>Almost every option in the game, no matter how stupid or sound, can be hard countered by something else</li>
                <li>Most of these hard counters are not sound in terms of risk/reward, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do them - you need to know when to do them</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Gimmicks and Situational Knowledge</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Having a bag of gimmicks and knowing when to use them is a legitimate skill</li>
                <li>Finishing a set with a gimmick or "onesie" is a fantastic way to close out a tense situation</li>
                <li>If you're insistent on just doing "what's good," you'll struggle against players who know when to use specific tricks</li>
                <li>Force people to play your game and you can win despite a skill disparity</li>
                <li>Players can make careers out of cheesing people in situations where they have no objective advantage, using disparity in situational knowledge and awareness</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Making Opponents Play Your Game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you can put people in mixup situations, especially ones you're familiar with that they have to learn on the fly, you're likely to come out ahead</li>
                <li>Pick options that counter strategically sound options - the fact that you know they're strategically sound makes it easier to read and pick the correct counter</li>
                <li>Example: After hitting shield, many people like to jab. ASDI down grab beats that. But if they expect ASDI down grab, raptor boost/running shine beats it</li>
                <li>Being better at RPS situations through experience means you can come out on top even when both players know the counters</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conditioning Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The best way to condition is to do something standard and low risk the first few times a situation comes up, then mix them up later in the set</li>
                <li>Sometimes it may be best to save your mixup for later in the set to trick them at a crucial moment</li>
                <li>In some situations, NOT mixing it up can be a really strong mixup - if successful, this tends to get in people's heads and tilt them</li>
                <li>If the flow of the match calls for it, don't be afraid to go for repetitive strong options</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Case Constructions (from Luninspectra)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The amount of case constructions you have determines your ability to play against new players comfortably</li>
                <li>You construct cases to mentally minimize the possible actions your opponent can take</li>
                <li>Example: Opponent double-jumps. They can only: 1) Come down with aerial, 2) Firefox/Illusion, 3) Waveland, 4) Land, 5) Airdodge</li>
                <li>Be a statistician and remember what they did when they double-jumped. Remember the primary action and secondary action</li>
                <li>Minimize it further: They'll either come down with aerial OR waveland. What move counters both?</li>
                <li>By minimizing actions to 2, your lowest chance to get them is 50% (assuming you do the right moves)</li>
                <li>Apply the best move for the situation or use it by chance/prediction</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Theory vs Practice</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>While it's easy to describe how matchups fundamentally "should" be played, it can be very hard to implement this knowledge</li>
                <li>At top level, theoretical descriptions are often inaccurate because of RPS, conditioning, and forcing opponents to play your game</li>
                <li>Players are getting better at creating frustrating situations where you can trick opponents and get juicy openings</li>
                <li>Even if theory says you shouldn't be able to hit your opponent, you can set up enough RPS situations to win exchanges</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Frame Advantage Breakdown</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Drill has variable frame advantage depending on which frame you land</li>
                <li>It's difficult to intentionally go for the better frames consistently</li>
                <li><strong>On spacies:</strong> Worst-case frame advantage is 5 frames, best-case is 7 frames</li>
                <li>Since grab hits frame 7, if you're frame-perfect with best-case frame advantage, the grab is guaranteed</li>
                <li>Your timing gets to be more consistent than your opponent's, making it difficult for them to shine quickly enough even if they technically have time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Counterplay & Mixups</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best counterplay for the defender:</strong> Buffered spot dodge - gets out of the way if Fox isn't perfect and doesn't require crazy timing</li>
                <li><strong>Buffered roll is NOT fast enough</strong> - you can charge up smash or dash back and wait out the spot dodge</li>
                <li>Once opponents start buffering spot dodge, you can mix them up with charged upsmash or dash back wait</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Neutral Game Concepts - Zamu</h2>
            
            <h3>Decision Making</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The most important thing for decision making and execution in any given situation in Melee: fully understand it, and it will be easier to look at. Learn each situation over and over again</li>
                <li>Play the RPS and then sprinkle everything else in</li>
                <li>There are other reasons why you should be beating people besides just adapting</li>
                <li>Attempt to always make decisions as humanly late as possible. Ideally every input you do should have been decided 15 frames before you do it. Kind of hard to do perfectly but what you should be aiming to do on a macro level</li>
                <li>Each time you look for a hit ask yourself "did I have the prerequisite advantage to do the thing I did?" and also "did I deserve to get a hit here?" If you ask yourself this and you say no, you probably shouldn't be attacking</li>
                <li>Be more careful about your move choices "does this move lead to a punish?" "does this move get me punished?"</li>
                <li>Choose less "read" options at the beginning of the game - wait like 5 or 10 more frames and dash dance which lets you react to a jump by seeing a short hop nair</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Situational Awareness</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Think more about the potential neutral win</li>
                <li>Don't lump spots together unless they need to be lumped together</li>
                <li>Don't think about how an opponent whiffed a move generally because you can be in so many different places</li>
                <li>Pick your spots to fight - the more you wait to fight the more likely you'll find a good opening</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Positioning & Stage Control</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Make your opponent prove that you have to be the one to approach, but that is never the case because of laser (i.e. Peach, Puff)</li>
                <li>Think more about what are good positions to be in rather than "I have a lead and my opponent needs to approach" or "I'm behind so I need to approach"</li>
                <li>Make your opponent force you to have a reason to approach rather than be pressured by attrition</li>
                <li>Approach when you need to approach and don't approach when you don't need to</li>
                <li>Take account of position and percent</li>
                <li>Practice staying in whiff punish range. Stop making hard reads - they are just straight up bad risk reward. It is basically just a very hopeful guess</li>
                <li>Look for clean neutral wins where if the opponent does something you can punish and if you don't you are still generally in advantage</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Stock & Percent Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stock lead means nothing in the ditto - percents matter a lot. Stock leads only matter if the game goes to time and game never goes to time in Fox dittos</li>
                <li>Percent matters if your opponent is higher than yours because if you just trade hits, you just win the game. Not necessarily what you want to be looking for - you want clean neutral because that situation is independent of the stock lead</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Movement & Spacing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>De-group your full hops (they are not grounded or actionable)</li>
                <li>If your opponent is just existing and you are full hopping you are at a mild disadvantage</li>
                <li>Make sure each full hop is individually fine and that you are not in full hop mode. Have a good reason for each full hop</li>
                <li>No reason to start drill high (unless you do FH drill and it combos on the ground) because you are aiming for your moves to hit and not whiff</li>
                <li>Replace giving up a lot of space to bait the opponent to move forward with aerial dash back or full hop in place</li>
                <li>If you are trying to corner pressure an opponent, give up space but not enough space to stop threatening your opponent</li>
                <li>Focus on using your movement to make the opponent uncomfortable</li>
                <li>To be patient - focus on doing nothing and keeping enough space between you and your opponent but still giving up space to dash dance into</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Patience & Not Attacking</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't attack if they are gonna whiff - the opponent doesn't know if you are doing a move or not, so you don't need to use that move!</li>
                <li>Focus on being actionable (specifically focus on not whiffing attacks that don't need to be whiffed) - stage position pressure</li>
                <li>Remove the spurts in your play where you give up on playing neutral entirely - take a deep breath</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Advantage State</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sometimes it's okay to hold a good position and you don't have to attack. As soon as you do something punishable you are no longer in an advantage state and can die</li>
                <li>As long as I play patient in advantage the risk reward is skewed in my favor</li>
                <li>When you have frame advantage, you know your opponent has to do something because they are in more lag than you are</li>
                <li>Don't bait your opponent - it is a more inconsistent way to play the game rather than just playing the position in a more simple manner</li>
                <li>Wait and screen look because the opponent needs to fight out of the corner regardless</li>
                <li>You are putting yourself in good positions but then you attack out of them and lose out on the value. Work on waiting to capitalize in these spots</li>
                <li>Start getting hit because you are not doing anything. When this happens, the opponent won the neutral game without getting a free hit, which is super duper sick</li>
                <li>Stop giving opponents free hits</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Corner Pressure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You don't have to nair into the corner because the opponent is already incentivized to fight out of the corner</li>
                <li>If the opponent isn't fighting for every 10 decisions, maybe you nair or running shine into the corner, or even pretend to do so - it's the threat that matters</li>
                <li>Figure out 4 options you want to do to corner pressure - be ready to hit him moving out of the corner</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Respawn Invincibility</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you respawn just play neutral - it is literally just Melee neutral but they can't hit you for a couple of seconds. You get to make a clean read in this moment</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How do I not get reversaled?</li>
                <li>How do I take my advantage as far as possible?</li>
                <li>Recognize when your combo is over and when the combo is over</li>
                <li>By playing you either: a) decrease disadvantage or b) find an advantage state</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Punish Game & Combo Extensions - Zamu</h2>
            
            <h3>Combo Theory</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Work on the up air follow up around 40 where the follow-up won't be a grab (could be platform, ledge, shy guys, etc.)</li>
                <li>Learning where to end the combo based on the situational variable - how does this become a kill?</li>
                <li>The correct answer in this case oftentimes is to reset to neutral</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tech Execution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice up throwing Fox onto BF / Stadium / Dreamland platform and doing full hop up air to cover 3/3 tech options</li>
                <li>Practice crouch canceling after whiffed aerials</li>
                <li>Short hop up air is good when the opponent is actionable - otherwise go for the full hop if you don't have time</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Marth Matchup Concepts - Billybopeep</h2>
            
            <h3>Neutral Game vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Marth doesn't have the way to defend himself in the corner like he does in the center</li>
                <li>If you are trying to whiff punish short hop fair range you want to be close enough that the drift does not do anything</li>
                <li>Full hop empty land and check what Marth does - this is faster than aerial and gives you visual time to confirm</li>
                <li>You can't ever hit anything Marth does with full hop unless you are preemptively doing it. This is part of the challenge against Marth in neutral</li>
                <li>Focus on knowing when Marth has to land - the spots that are coming up are spots where Marth has to land on the ground. These are the moments where you need to whiff punish Marth or pressure him</li>
                <li>If you don't have the frames to directly punish him you need to setup for pressure</li>
                <li>Apply aggressive dash back to whiff punish or pressure in these situations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Corner Pressure vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Be more willing to throw out hitboxes in the corner ONCE YOU HAVE MARTH IN THE ZONE NEAR THE INNER LIP</li>
                <li>The difference between Marth and Falco in the corner is that you can't get away with walling pressure - you have to pick a move sometimes and dash out</li>
                <li>As soon as you see Marth do a normal, the opportunity to whiff punish that is already over. Internalize that you need to read Marth doing something to hit him or change gears to pressure or position</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Movement vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Full hop drift neutral or drift away at Marth - never drift at Marth. If you do he will ALWAYS get away first and the moves he has are too fast + dash back</li>
                <li>If you are close enough to Marth and he doesn't know what's happening, if Marth is dashing toward you while you are dashing back it is not great because the decision tree becomes much more complicated</li>
                <li>What makes dash back offensively good: when Marth is in Fox's threat range he is constantly in a place where you can't react to Fox's aerials. It sets up the time so if Marth tries to stop you offensively you will be ready to hit him for it</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Punish Game vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Recognize when you have a meaningful hit, but not a direct combo, and what mixup needs to be played accordingly. Super important concept for fighting Marth</li>
                <li>If you are not sure if your shine will connect cleanly or at all, waveshine down</li>
                <li>On missed tech against Marth think about up tilt and short hop up air off of a knockdown</li>
                <li>DO NOT full hop falling bair - it does NOTHING against Marth EVER</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recovery vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If Marth is close to edge in a way where the up-B curls under the stage, you want to double jump back to refresh instead of Firefox</li>
                <li>Vertically far away = DJ back to refresh to cover yourself</li>
                <li>Horizontally far away = DJ in place to refresh to cover yourself</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tether Theory</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The tether is that if you are really far away from Marth you have to get close to Marth. You are either directly in front of Marth, or completely out of the range</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Laser Usage vs Marth</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you are going to laser, stop picking offensive option after - it's detrimental</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Floaty Mid-Tier Concepts - Billybopeep</h2>
            
            <h3>Understanding Mid-Tier Characters</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mid tiers - they have less relevant options. Sit down and map out their real options</li>
                <li>You can teach someone how to approach a mid tier matchup in an hour - look at every move they have, what does the character's kit make their goals?</li>
                <li>Stop overgeneralizing - fight DK by knowing his linear neutral. You can just wait and laser and then do things that make it hard to interact. DK close range doesn't get much off of anything when facing forward</li>
                <li>X character has Y weakness and therefore because of X character and Y weakness I must play Z way</li>
                <li>Make generalizations that allow you to perceive the information correctly - the generalizations are not the answers themselves but instead the path to the answers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Character Weakness Analysis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Example: Luigi's main weakness is that he doesn't have horizontal drift, which means that the angles he can approach from are limited. As Fox with unlimited movement, you can outmaneuver the Luigi player. The thought process is outmaneuvering Luigi by making it hard to find approach options</li>
                <li>Is there a way that I can decide to engage with this character? If so, how? If not, how do I minimize the engagement rate?</li>
                <li>Mid tiers are mid tiers because they are more vulnerable, and you can force situations where engagement is impossible</li>
                <li>You can simply run away, and sometimes they are unable to stop you because of their kit</li>
                <li>Picking proper engagement points is a key driving principle in theory for beating mid tier characters</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Neutral Strategy vs Mid-Tiers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay in slight advantage until you find a spot to engage in</li>
                <li>Respect the floaty mid tier kit - but don't respect the non-functional moves</li>
                <li>Know what is and isn't good in their kit and exploit them for doing the bad things</li>
                <li>Understand the character dynamic. Figure out the character weakness and engage with them properly (which implies correct timing)</li>
                <li>Do a variety of things - and don't do the same thing. Neutral is actually what is difficult for these characters, therefore once you do the same thing and they catch on they can do the thing where they potentially hit you really hard which is what makes them a mid tier and not a low tier</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Defense & Shield Game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Know what is and isn't shield grabbable. Understand inherent qualities of moves and their various applications (Fox nair, Falco shine, Marth nair, Sheik fair when L-canceled)</li>
                <li>Setup options in training mode and check if it's safe</li>
                <li>Understand what characters can do after a hit on shield. Sometimes you can just press the A button instead of shine OOS</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Punish Game vs Mid-Tiers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Figure out where the mid tier has no options and follow up and abuse punishes as a result of knowing that character can't do anything when you counter-hit</li>
                <li>They have to work really hard to do anything when you engage with their weaknesses directly</li>
                <li>Whiff landing lag of back air against Donkey Kong - this character doesn't have X option which makes Y option more reasonable</li>
                <li>Another example could be Samus down smash having way more lag than initially appears</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practice Drills</h3>

            <h3>Combo Enders</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If your combo ender is an up air, and it doesn't kill, it usually is the wrong combo ender - consider up throw bair when you would normally try to finish the combo</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Kill Confirms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Work on hard DI away JC up smash kill confirms around 100%</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tech Execution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice drill shine link when they SDI away and try to shine first</li>

            <h3>Dash Back Framework</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your dash back is used to look and check and then you can use prediction confirmation off of the look and check</li>
                <li>This is all range dependent and will only work if both of you are inside each other's threat range</li>
                <li>Get better at whiff punishing - and get them to whiff using your movement - use the dash back look and check framework</li>
                <li>If you are actually close enough to threaten each other - that is the range where you can whiff punish</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Uncertainty & Panic Situations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When there is some uncertainty in these panic situations - wait for panic double jump bair and feel it out, then stand still and dash back and grab</li>
                <li>If you are uncertain of what your opponent is going to do, you should consider waiting until the last possible second you think you could get hit and then dash back and looking for a dash dance grab if you don't know what exactly they want</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Late Tech Chase Situations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you are extremely late on a tech chase - recognize that you are playing a mixup and use your space well accordingly</li>
                <li>You can bait him into attacking you - or nair him in the face</li>

            <h3>Recovery Timing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You have time to refresh when they are below the stage in the start of a Firefox - pay attention to the refresh</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Anti-Reversal Coverage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Turn around and back air if you think they are going to try to reversal you with a landing aerial</li>
                <li>You either get the chance to kill them for the double jump aerial or you are wrong and they go to ledge and they have to play out of disadvantage anyways</li>
                <li>To do this: do a late bair and drift away - do this really late and it will be really hard for them to hit you with the Firefox</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Chem's Fox Edgeguard Flowchart</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Do shine to cover the angle to ledge - this covers almost any angle that goes to ledge</li>
                <li>Any angle that DOESN'T go to ledge (bar a specific high angle) should cover the other options besides the ledge</li>
                <li>If they go high enough to the point where the bair from the shine back air whiffs, then you do another bair from the stage</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Combo Game vs Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>On full DI, you can combo with full hop but with no DI you have to do double jump up air</li>
                <li>Your biggest combos are from getting under Sheik and keeping her above you with up air and bair</li>
                <li>Double jump back bair on no invincibility Sheik back air</li>
                <li>Don't look for short hop up air on opponents above the platform because you are way farther than you would be when you land on the platform where you would be closer for more damage</li>
                <li>Practice reading Sheik jump with double jump up air</li>
                <li>How to hit a second hit up air - hit the highest possible point</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Up Throw Combos & DI Mixups</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mixup your drift on up throw up air - drift in the same way as the SDI you are expecting them to do</li>
                <li>Practice up throw up air with act out of wait (right now you are doing 4 frame DJ when it needs to be way faster)</li>
                <li>Build your intuition around how to do a combo - these are the kinds of things where if you have a full understanding of how you want to execute these things so it is not a question for you</li>
                <li>Given the variables, you know that you will not be able to hit something a certain way</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tech Chasing Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice full hop on frame 37 on Sheik to cover missed tech</li>
                <li>Up throw Sheik and then full hop falling up air which covers missed tech and a grab on the rolls. DON'T RUN ALL THE WAY TO THE CORNER ON THE ROLLS</li>
                <li>Practice teching down tilt and f tilt while being tech chased and scraps at higher percents. This will get you more mileage in scraps and disadvantage to get out of the bad situation sooner</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Edgeguarding Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>GRAB LEDGE AFTER HITTING SHEIK OFFSTAGE MORE OFTEN</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Platform Play vs Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Abuse CC on the platform</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Neutral & Decision Making vs Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Look for late nair</li>
                <li>Be more certain of what you want after landing</li>
                <li>Work on not rushing recoveries</li>
                <li>If it was not possible for you to get reversaled no matter what, what would you want?</li>
                <li>Be very specific with each action placed</li>
                <li>Do drop down shine because you want the shine to hit, not because you want to turn around</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mindset vs Sheik</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To maintain patience, think about what you know not to do</li>
            </ul>
