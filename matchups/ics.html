            <h2>General Concepts</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Nana States</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nana has 2 primary states of being: Connected and disconnected</li>
                    <li><strong>Connected:</strong> Her inputs are coming from the player</li>
                    <li><strong>Disconnected:</strong> The AI is taking over</li>
                    <li>Nana, when connected, gets the exact same inputs, just 6 frames later</li>
                    <li>Every frame that nana is connected, regardless of whether she is on the ground or in the air, she is acted on by a force that attracts her to popo's position</li>
                    <li>Nana is forced to look the same direction that popo was looking 5 frames prior</li>
                    <li>Desyncs are still in the connected state, the inputs just act on whoever is actionable</li>
                    <li>Nana cannot connect out of the teeter animation</li>
                    <li>Squall hammer (side B) and Belay (up B) force connection</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Connection Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To connect, 3 things must be true: Both climbers must be on the ground, Climbers must be within the connection distance, Climbers must have nearly equivalent momentum</li>
                    <li>Climbers can connect even on different platforms as long as they are grounded and nearby</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="matchup-content">
            <h2>Nana AI Behavior</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Nana's CPU level is determined by popo's damage</li>
                    <li>When disconnected, the AI may go into a "chase state" where she just wants to get back to popo</li>
                    <li>If she reaches the spot, she waits for popo to land so she can reconnect</li>
                    <li>If she is in hitlag, she is disconnected</li>
                    <li>She will never attack while in recovery mode</li>
                    <li>She will always try to land on randall rather than the main stage</li>
                    <li>She has an attack mode where she can attack or dodge</li>
                    <li>She will only throw out a move if it is in range</li>
                    <li><strong>At level 0:</strong> She pretty much just jabs</li>
                    <li><strong>At level 3:</strong> She gains blizzard</li>
                    <li><strong>At level 4:</strong> She gets aerials</li>
                    <li><strong>At level 6 (~120%):</strong> She may even grab</li>
                    <li>If she's trying to wait to reconnect and an opponent shows up, she might swing</li>
                    <li>She cannot go straight to attack from hitlag or recovery</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="matchup-content">
            <h2>Strategy & Concepts</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Ice climbers are weak against the outer edge of side platform</li>
                    <li>After a shine, we can get a running double shine</li>
                    <li>After they full hop up air, ICs have two primary options: Fair (Hard to space around with both hammers around, Will smack you if you try to run up CC the dair), Dair (Can be CC'd, Can't really whiff punish)</li>
                    <li>Between stocks, go to the far edge of a platform</li>
                    <li>Weird things happen with hitting their shield. It's possible to hit both shields at different times, causing double hitlag</li>
                    <li>Nana can buffer a frame perfect grab on shield by holding A during shield stun</li>
                    <li>Use drill when they aren't shielding, like whiff punishing fair after they use FH up air</li>
                    <li>Can full hop shine vs up air as a mixup to waiting for them to come down</li>
                    <li>Nana cannot fast fall or tech</li>
                    <li>If you up throw, popo is forced to double jump</li>
                    <li>It is best to throw them offstage if possible</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <div class="matchup-content">
            <h2>Playstyles</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>There are 2 main styles of play: Full hop over them and shine, Up tilt / Get them in the air some how</li>
                    <li>If nana is recovering, short hop → shine → shinestall</li>
                    <li>Don't stand near Nana for too long; she may swing</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="matchup-content">
            <h2>Three Important Situational Goals</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Fox pulls nana and kills her instantly</li>
                    <li>Fox gets popo alone and nana just stands around useless while you beat up the main climber</li>
                    <li>Fox combos nana and every time popo tries to save her, you hit him for it</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="matchup-content">
            <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Look to edgeguard using full hop Bair</li>
                    <li>Falling up air is stronger than drill if they whiff</li>
                    <li>Don't try to dash dance punish. Being on the ground too much or too long is dangerous</li>
                    <li>FD and Stadium are strong for ICs because there is no top platform to escape to</li>
                    <li>We kind of have to camp sopo really hard</li>
                    <li>If they ledgedash, we must respect it and keep our distance, while pressuring them to approach</li>
                    <li>Use full hop to beat down smash / grab / other grounded options</li>
                    <li>Against up throw, we can slight DI behind and jump out</li>
                    <li>It is sometimes better to stay on a platform for a while than it is to switch platforms often</li>
                    <li>On battlefield if you JC shine nana offstage, waveland on platform → run off shine should catch nana's recovery</li>
                    <li>If popo is 0-20%, she will getup attack</li>
                    <li>Hold away during ledge handoffs to avoid throw f smash</li>
                    <li>If they are on platform, you can dash dance or get under them and up tilt</li>
                    <li>If they have to side B from below, nana can't grab edge, and neither can popo</li>
                    <li>Falling up air, especially on the back of their shield is really strong</li>
                    <li>Do not jump and land in center stage</li>
                    <li>On FD, stay grounded, use lots of shine</li>
                    <li>Never up tilt nana; popo will destroy us in many cases</li>
                    <li>Go to edge between stocks</li>
                    <li>Waveshine → walk → shine rather than dash JC shine because Popo can get us sometimes for the dash JC shine. Being caught without double jump is really bad</li>
                    <li>Popo is very likely to Fair while coming down</li>
                    <li>To edgehog Nana, either getup attack or roll</li>
                    <li>If you see blizzard, just wait</li>
                    <li>Neutral is largely about using shine to split them up effectively</li>
