            <h2>Neutral Game</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>General Neutral Strategy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yoshi has trouble if you shoot him with a laser and has a seizure on the platform</li>
                    <li>Use wavedash back down tilt to retreat from his approaching fair hitbox, or you can up tilt and trade with it</li>
                    <li>Hide under side platforms - it's your safe zone</li>
                    <li>Shielding is pretty good vs Yoshi because fair is his only good move on shield. Everything else has to be spaced properly otherwise you will be able to punish out of shield (shine, shield grab, up smash, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Yoshi's Shield Mechanics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yoshi shield behaves differently than other characters - you can't shield poke him</li>
                    <li>He can't act out of shield drop quicker and also is able to parry</li>
                    <li>His shield is pretty bad if you drill it on the ground and he can only roll, spotdodge, or shield grab (usually will roll)</li>
                    <li>Yoshi's double jab on your shield is shield grabbable</li>
                    <li>Light shield to avoid getting poked in corner by Yoshi down tilt</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Percent-Based Gameplan</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Play the %s - your gameplan should be mostly drills, lasers and grabs at low %</li>
                    <li>While his % racks up, up smashes, up airs and up tilts start to unlock</li>
                    <li>Near kill % you gain access to your back air and nair</li>
                    <li>Due to his parry and double jump armor it's very risky using unsafe moves, so make sure you read up on your %s</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Platform Pressure Mixups</h3>
                <p>Yoshi will shield on platforms a lot and you want to make it look like you are going to hit him so he wants to shield drop. Here are some tricky setups:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full hop bair his shield and drift far away</li>
                    <li>Full hop on top of shield and aerial into block (super low aerial)</li>
                    <li>Full hop on top of shield and fall through the platform without an aerial - from here you can up tilt under the platform, crouch cancel, or jump at his shield again and repeat the situation</li>
                    <li>Short hop up air fake out where you fast fall early and he shield drops because he thinks you did something bad on his shield, and you up tilt him for it</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="matchup-content">
            <h2>Punish Game & Combos</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Bread and Butter Combos</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drill waveshine up smash is your bread and butter - you can tech chase with up airs off it</li>
                    <li>Up throw up air isn't a true combo as Yoshi can tank it, but you can drift away from Yoshi and space outside of his nair</li>
                    <li>Waveshine down tilt is also a solid conversion</li>
                    <li>Forward throw dash attack on DI in starting around 40%</li>
                    <li>Down throw running shine up smash on tech rolls (6 frames faster than up smash, can shine grab if you are late)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Kill Confirms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Soft nair up smash</li>
                    <li>Waveshine up smash</li>
                    <li>Dash attack up air (he probably armored it) into another up air</li>
                    <li>Down throw tech chase up smash</li>
                    <li>Taking his double jump off stage</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dreamland:</strong> 112%</li>
                    <li><strong>Battlefield:</strong> 99%</li>
                    <li><strong>Yoshi's:</strong> 90%</li>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>DI & SDI</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>DI up on Yoshi's up airs is good because he is unlikely to string together as many up airs as he wants - you will eventually gain the ability to jump out</li>
                    <li>Fox can ASDI down Yoshi nair below 23% and CC it below 54%</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Tech Game</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hit your techs - Yoshi prays off jab reset</li>
                    <li>If you think you have to tech in a situation you are probably wrong and you will get tech trapped a lot by Yoshi</li>
                    <li>Amsah teching and ASDI down teching works on a lot of his moves</li>
                    <li>There's a lot of tech chase situations where he can down smash you off - be sure to Amsah tech it</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Defensive Options</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crouch cancel is really good vs Yoshi as you can tank a lot of his moves and shine him</li>

            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Egg Escape</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Egg mash out time is the same at all %s</li>
                    <li>Usually mash and back air out of it - you can also waveland or double jump</li>
                    <li>Mixup your mashing timings</li>
                    <li>Practice mashing out of off stage egg</li>

                <h3>Breaking Double Jump Armor</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wait until he reaches the apex of his jump to edgeguard him so he can't armor</li>
                    <li>Prioritize moves that break armor</li>
                    <li>Up air does a great job of breaking double jump armor</li>
                    <li>Up smashing his rising double jump can be good since it breaks armor early</li>
                    <li>Shine up air is better than shine bair because it breaks the armor quicker</li>
                    <li>Getting above Yoshi while he's jumpless can be very effective</li>

                    <li>Watch out for his landing fair</li>
