            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Matchup Fundamentals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Marth is really fast with an insane dash dance animation</li>
                    <li>Beating Marth involves making Marth whiff moves</li>
                    <li>Run in and make him have to protect himself (hopefully it means he swings)</li>
                    <li>Mix up run timing and possibly shield or CC last second when we are already in his face</li>
                    <li>The issue with trying to attack Marth is that you can always just get grabbed</li>
                    <li>Getting grabbed at high % isn't as bad, but still isn't good</li>
                    <li>It is hard for marth to grab you when you're not approaching</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Preventing Marth Approach</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can prevent Marth approach with: lasers, platforms, and staying out of range</li>
                    <li>If he tries to slowly take stage with aerials and dtilt, this is where we can whiff punish</li>
                    <li>We need to know exactly where his sword ends every time he jumps</li>
                    <li>You still have to make a read after Marth misses an aerial</li>
                    <li>There are ways to hedge bets a little for punish</li>
                    <li>It is important to show Marth that you're willing to laser in place if they will just aerial in place</li>
                    <li>Marth's dash forward is the weakest part of the matchup</li>
                    <li>Make him respect that you're faster</li>
                    <li>Accept that everything he does has a mixup</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>General Strategy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Punishing Marth = Juggling or edgeguarding</li>
                    <li>We lose at low % but are better at high %</li>
                    <li>Live long while staying threatening</li>
                    <li>Be okay with scrambles; get close. This is known as the tether range in other circles</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="matchup-content">
            <h2>Juggling Marth (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Juggle Strategy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When juggling, try to get directly below him</li>
                    <li>Make sure you avoid Dair when he's coming down!</li>
                    <li>With beating dair established, they will stall more</li>
                    <li>If you can't juggle him directly or get directly under him and they have access to Fair, relax and play it slow</li>
                    <li>Grand scheme, mix these up with initially conceding space and letting him land</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="matchup-content">
            <h2>Up Throw Follow-ups (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>On up throw up air, we can delay the up air to beat SDI, but it would risk them jumping</li>
                    <li>On platform stages, we can use fair after up throw to get combos like fair → turn up tilt and fair → up smash</li>
                    <li>Up throw → shine can be good to force them offstage</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="matchup-content">
            <h2>Edgeguarding Marth (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Edgeguard Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Edgeguarding is complicated but possible / exploitable</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 1:</strong> Marth uses stalls to grab edge eventually</li>
                    <li>Once they're really stalling and dealing with your ledge timing, dropping down with shine becomes more deadly</li>
                    <li>If they are close enough to air dodge, it is important to cover</li>
                    <li>If up smash will kill, standard Marth killer is useful</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Marth Killer Variations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Need Marth Killer 2.0 - Stand with light shield, and get shield DI input to get ledge</li>
                    <li>Grand scheme when it comes to edgeguarding using Marth Killer: mix up timing and positioning</li>
                    <li>Grabbing edge and dropping with shine Bair can be good</li>
                    <li>Grabbing edge, tanking the up B hit, and getting an up smash on stage can work as long as we're under 30%</li>
                    <li>Ledgedash up smash or ledgedash shine can be good to beat on stage up B</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>General Edgeguarding Plan</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Threaten Marth killer when marth can double jump to ledge, but not stage</li>
                    <li>Mix up timing and positioning</li>
                    <li>Be ready to adapt to their recovery mixups</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="matchup-content">
            <h2>Key Moves (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dtilt:</strong> Good, but loses to CC kinda easily, and loses to jumps</li>
                    <li><strong>Up Tilt:</strong> Good if you know they are jumping towards you</li>
                    <li><strong>Ftilt / Dsmash:</strong> Good for edgeguarding out of CC at low %</li>
                    <li><strong>Dash Attack:</strong> Pretty good at high % according to Leffen</li>
                    <li><strong>Jab:</strong> Great wakeup option, and can be good as an overshoot</li>
                </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="matchup-content">
            <h2>Defense & Survival</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Getting Grabbed</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn how to survive the chaingrab (You can't)</li>
                    <li>Ensure you DI F-throw down and away if possible</li>
                    <li>On up throw up tilt, DI the up tilt downwards</li>
                    <li>Learn to slide off! Hold away + C stick down</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Recovery</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recovery is key. Shorten is good, but don't let double jab win</li>
                    <li>Certain timings of side B after a double jump can sneak past him</li>
                    <li>Rising airdodge is good, but it can also be reactable</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>High % Play</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shield more at high%. Avoid Nair, Side B, and up tilt</li>
                    <li>Do not feel the need to approach; Make them approach</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Battlefield:</strong> Good for both</li>

                    <li><strong>Yoshi's:</strong> Good for both</li>
                    <li><strong>Dreamland:</strong> Good for both</li>
                    <li><strong>Pokemon / Final Destination:</strong> Generally considered worse for Fox</li>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Movement & Positioning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Default fullhop should be non-fastfall</li>
                    <li>Important to know what you can and can't punish</li>
                    <li>Important to stand still when you can't get hit</li>
                    <li>It can be good to just crouch at low %</li>
                    <li>Powershield pushes you further away than standard shield</li>
                    <li>Marth full hop rising fair should be punished on reaction</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Dealing with Down Tilt</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can shield grab down tilt, but it's frame perfect. Possible with a plan, but still really hard</li>
                    <li>After getting down tilted there is a mixup</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Approach Options</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are full hops that can beat side B floats</li>
                    <li>Short hop around up B</li>
                    <li>Fast fall empty hop grab is strong, and it beats crouch in scrambles, though crouch is also useful</li>
                    <li>Run up crouch is apparently really good vs Marth</li>
                    <li>Land on the back of Marth's shield with up air</li>
                    <li>Drill in place(ish) is okay if neutral is established, but less so as a guess or presumption</li>
                    <li>Don't try to get in on Marth before you know what he wants</li>
                    <li>Best combo is nair across the stage to beat late fair</li>
                    <li>Walling bairs are not useful for fox vs Marth</li>
                    <li>Make Marth use Nair to protect himself and be right out of range and DD grab</li>
                    <li>Make Marth's defense barely miss, and give yourself an advantage</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Range Management</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When sharking, use dash dance to react to a side B that can be hit with back air</li>
                    <li>Fox wants to be far away enough to laser, or close enough to hit a dash back, and once fox gets in that range, we want to use buttons to rip Marth apart</li>
                    <li>Max range of dash attack is the edge of mid range</li>
                    <li>Marth's Nair is telling fox that if we close the gap from mid → short that fox will get hit</li>
                    <li>Fair for Marth is more for aggression, Nair is the better defensive aerial for Marth</li>
                    <li>Marth's main options in the tether range are dash and shield</li>
                    <li>Foxes want to wait for the nair and push forward</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Ledge Play</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fox should be dash dancing near center stage when marth is on the ledge. If we are on platform, they can ledgedash up tilt and then we die</li>
                    <li>The angle very slightly above edge is really hard for Marth to cover</li>
                    <li>They want to dash or shield when pressured after landing</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>SDI & DI</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use SDI up on up airs in marth combos. They will have to adapt</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Marth Side B Float Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Marth has to land on stage to get the pseudo jump floaty side B back</li>
                    <li>Landing on stage with an aerial or other special moves including counter to not give it back</li>
                    <li>If the aerial auto cancels, that would give it back</li>
                    <li>Wavedashing is a way to get it back</li>
                    <li>Thus with all of these rules, if they use something like an L canceled fair to get back on stage, and only dash dance afterwards before getting hit off, they will not have the floaty side B</li>
