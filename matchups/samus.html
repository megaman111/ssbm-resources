                <ul>
                    <li>Outside of being under top platform, we can punish up B if it is not edge canceled</li>
                    <li>We can hold up and away to DI and get out, then laser land and up smash</li>
                    <li>If up B is not a threat / gets her punished, she must wavedash (back) to leave shield</li>
                    <li>Drill in place is unlikely to work as a way of containing her</li>

            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>If you drill, it apparently should be approaching drill to deal with retreats</li>
                    <li>You can also nair in a way that hits in front of her, but lands behind her</li>
                    <li>Extremely well spaced bair is OK after 30, but still not exactly desirable</li>
                    <li>Down smash can be wavedash up smash punished</li>
                    <li>If you can, get running shield vs f tilt</li>
                    <li>Samus wants to up tilt on our shield</li>
                    <li>Running down tilt is strong, especially when down tilt up air kills</li>
                    <li>High / Early aerials lose to up B, but if we can DI up B, it isn't strong</li>

            <h2>Neutral & Approach</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>If they try to approach behind a missile, Nair the missile</li>
                    <li>Do not up smash samus at low %, she will tech it and down smash us</li>
                    <li>At low % it is better to grab than up smash, even though grab has no guaranteed follow up</li>
                    <li>After up throw, if they do an aerial or a bomb and we full hop into it, we lose</li>
                    <li>If we get a waveshine near edge, grabbing and throwing her off may be best</li>
                    <li>Running shine → full hop → Falling up air can technically work</li>
                    <li>At high % weak bair and nair can both lead to up smash or up air</li>
                    <li>If we grab ledge at nearly the same time, we can hold edge longer</li>
                    <li>Ledgedash → shield is pretty good since her grab is mid</li>

            <h2>Ideas from Billy</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>When it comes to acting on the second forward intention, there are options for feinting after the dash in</li>
                    <li>We want samus in the air, and we want to be grounded</li>
                    <li>Down tilt, grab, and waveshine → launcher are preferred ways to get her in the air</li>
                    <li>Down tilt is a good forward facing poke. Often pokes under shield</li>
                    <li>Lasering a lot is very strong in this matchup</li>
                    <li>Fox is clearly winning when samus is chasing fox</li>
                    <li>It is best to wavedash directly under samus to give access to up tilt or up air</li>
                    <li>Samus jumping is a cue to get to ground as fast and safely as possible</li>
                    <li>Wavedash up tilt and up smash both work vs F smash on shield</li>
                    <li>Even fully spaced, Bair can get CC D smashed. Just don't</li>
                    <li>The higher up samus bombs, the more time you have to get straight under her</li>
                    <li>Bair sharking can be strong, just to advance the situation</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Thoughts from Fiction</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Stay grounded, look for down tilt, up air, up smash, and laser</li>
                    <li>Grab and get her in the air. Stay grounded and punish</li>
                    <li>Running shine after dashing back is strong</li>
                    <li>Look for openings that put her in the air</li>
                    <li>Samus kills fox by edgeguarding</li>
                    <li>Do not push into the corner, she may just kill us, especially at low %</li>
                    <li>CC shine vs fair off ledge</li>
                    <li>You can tank a bomb to make her recover lower</li>
                    <li>Best kills are off the top</li>
                    <li>Her most vulnerable point is landing; she will be afraid</li>
                    <li>Do not fall onto samus, it sets her up for success</li>
                    <li>If you are afraid, go to ledge and ledge dash</li>
                    <li>Do not use double jump on FD unnecessarily. Having to land is a problem</li>
                    <li>Primary goal is to get her to 70% without risking our life</li>
                    <li>Both characters are meant to be grounded. Wait to see bombs before jumping for up airs while sharking</li>
                    <li>Committing while she's high up is useless; she is much more vulnerable near the ground</li>
                    <li>It is okay to be relatively safe on the edgeguard. Do not get reversaled</li>
                    <li>Falling up air → Up air looks good at around 55%</li>
                    <li>If we see a missile near ground that samus jumps over, we can intercept them in the air with Nair or maybe even up air</li>
                    <li>Do NOT running shine often; she wants to hit down smash and that is a bad interaction</li>
                    <li>Aim drill to overshoot</li>
                    <li>From up throw: up tilt the air under her</li>
                    <li>Wavedash jab oos at kill % might work vs f tilt</li>
                    <li>Drill grab works, drill up tilt is okay, drill shine is unreliable</li>
                    <li>Run up shield is annoying for them; their grab is bad (slow/reactable)</li>
                    <li>Up smash near edge is good, cause if they shield, they just get pushed to ledge</li>
                    <li>Run around and laser, and if she guesses wrong, you'll hit her after retreating to platform enough</li>

            <h2>Cookbook: Neutral</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Running Shield</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>An easy place to start when building a neutral vs her is with running shield. Most of her moves, besides spaced ftilt which you usually take space after blocking, can be reliably punished on reaction oos. This will force her to preemptive grab you, where everything else including jump is now unlocked</li>
                    <li>Once you've running shielded enough, the samus will try to hard call it out. If you do anything else you can just punish her on reaction</li>
                    <li>Run up shield is obnoxious, eventually you can preemptively attack if they just refuse to bite OR grab (which you can obviously punish too)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Using Platforms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's hard to get safe dmg at low %, one way is to laser and use plats to get her to chase you. If she jumps on the plat and guesses wrong she gets tagged</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Down Tilt</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dtilt knocks down on asdi down at 23%, cc at 63% all hitboxes (dtilt has 3 hitboxes, one sends straight up, one 80 degrees, the other at 70 degrees but this doesn't matter for knockdown %s)</li>
                    <li>She can no longer AT holding both sticks straight down 47-55% depending on the hitbox (90 degree one 47%, 70 degree 55%)</li>
                    <li>Meaning, if you're using it to contest wd back or shield poke it gets unlocked at these %s, with ASDI down being the more relevant %s as that's what she'll be doing when she's unable to truly be in crouch (in shield, wavedash lag, ftilt recovery etc)</li>
                    <li>KJH often mid air shines to reflect missiles as he's not stuck in lag on the ground, making him much harder to punish, plus DJ is much quicker than grounded jump as you have no jump squat and can quickly jump to a plat</li>
                    <li>If you go for a dtilt call out on movement/shield poke, it's kinda awkward to punish sometimes. Samus might be tempted to try and grab it, as you'll generally be shielding after most of your moves, which can be hard punished even out of a hard</li>
                    <li>Laser some to bait her to try and contest but do not nair in here, dtilt is a much better move to catch grounded movement due to its huge range and how it pops her up nicely for an actual combo (and eventually an uair to kill). If you shffl in you'll probably die which is not fun</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>If Samus is Above You</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sh uair works really well when she's above you, as well as bairing her landings per usual. Even if she got shield out, it would have set up a shield poke</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Kill %</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>At kill %, you can kinda brazenly usmash her landings as all the bomb nonsense mainly serves to cancel your recovery if they hit you, and whether she missiles, nairs, or whatever doesn't really matter as they'll mostly result in her dying if you just call out when, as opposed to how she will</li>
                    <li>Weak nair breaks asdi down at 76%, which is fine since the main use is an usmash set up on samus WDing around anyways. Also if she's not near a ledge to ledge cancel it, it's often a mix up for her if she'll land on the platform or the ground. Usually they'll choose platform as landing on the ground risks an usmash, but since good foxes KNOW that they'll tend to land on the platform for that reason</li>
