                <h3>Matchup Overview</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Peach is a slow character with great frame data, hitboxes, recovery, and crouch cancel</li>
                    <li>Do not overextend! Try to get clean hits</li>
                    <li>If you Dair and they're in the air, it sucks. If you nair and they're on the ground, it also sucks</li>
                    <li>Peach at low % - Run away and laser, she is slow!</li>
                    <li>Use lasers and platforms to get her in the air</li>
                    <li>Dair beats crouch cancel, but it is very hard to hit a clean drill</li>
                    <li>Up throw up air does not true combo</li>
                    <li>Focus on making her approach and hitting her in the air</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Dealing with Down Smash</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>To beat down smash, don't interact with it</li>
                    <li>Down smash pokes the back of shield due to our tail</li>
                    <li>Do not hit peach with weak aerials</li>
                    <li>Wavedash up tilt, grab, and up smash can directly punish down smash</li>
                    <li>If peach is on platform at low % do not interact</li>

            <h2>Dealing with Dash Attack</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Dash attack is only a problem if near the ledge or very close quarters where she gets the strong hit</li>
                    <li>Our dair and nair both trade or lose to dash attack very often. Bair can still win, shield and CC work, and we punish it with grab and waveshine</li>
                    <li>While shield and CC beat dash attack, they lose to grab</li>
                    <li>Full hop and using platforms are both good for avoiding dash attack</li>

            <h2>Dealing with Fair</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Peach fair has high priority, it knocks down early, and once its out, we cannot challenge it</li>
                    <li>Depending on her float height, we can use these moves to hit the startup of fair</li>
                    <li>Low aerials can combo in to down smash or force us into shield where we can get grabbed</li>
                    <li>Rolling away after low aerials beats grab and down smash but requires space</li>
                    <li>Do not CC → shine vs aerials unless the waveshine up smash would kill</li>
                    <li>You can punish peach landing from fair with up smash and shine, but it is risky</li>

            <h2>% Based Concepts (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Once we are at mid % it becomes harder to run away</li>
                    <li>At mid %, peach up throw combos us better, and up air starts to knock down</li>
                    <li>Starting near 20% she will full hop up air to catch our full hop out of the corner</li>
                    <li>To avoid getting full hop up air'd, we have to mix in dashing directly under</li>
                    <li>At mid % dash attack becomes a bigger threat so we are inclined to shield more</li>
                    <li>At high % D-tilt becomes a threat, as it can lead to up smash, which can kill</li>
                    <li>Dealing with down tilt can be hard, as it has a big pull back</li>
                    <li>Down smash is usually better, but wavedash back down tilt is a problem for us at higher %</li>
                    <li>If you can, tech down smash back through the peach and roll away further</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="matchup-content">
            <h2>Dealing with Turnips</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>She can use turnips to help deal with platform camping</li>
                    <li>Hold shield if turnip hits it</li>
                    <li>If they are directly approaching with the turnip, Bair / Nair through it and hit her</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Getting Clean Hits</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Getting a clean hit can be hard. Often, the best thing to do is hit her for trying to hit a reversal on us</li>
                    <li>Peach airdodge goes very far. She will use it to: Escape juggles, Get on stage, Avoid jab follow-ups</li>
                    <li>Peach air dodge is often punishable on reaction, but sometimes we must specifically call it out</li>
                    <li>If we call out her air dodge, we should aim to hit her with up tilt or up air at mid %, and up smash at %s where it kills</li>

            <h2>Waveshine & Grab Game</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Waveshine up tilt is key. Gives access to: juggle situations and platform tech chases</li>
                    <li>Grab is okay vs peach. Up throw up air is useful to attempt at both low and high %</li>
                    <li>At mid % up air is functionally useless</li>
                    <li>Show that you are willing to up throw up air if they do not defend, but aim to switch to hitting the double jump / air dodge out</li>
                    <li>Throwing peach offstage rather than playing the mix out of up throw is occasionally useful</li>
                    <li>Down throw → Tech read is pretty meh</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Float Heights</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low Float:</strong> If she is doing a low float where she has barely jumped, we can jump over her and hit with Dair, Bair, or falling up air depending on %. Peach tends to do this low float out of shield or in part of a punish</li>
                    <li><strong>Mid Height Float:</strong> If her float is mid height, around our short hop Nair height, she will most likely Dair or Bair. Sometimes short hop up air can catch peach from her preferred mid height float. We cannot challenge fair, even from a mid-height float, but other aerials can be shined oos</li>
                    <li><strong>High Float:</strong> A high float, done from a full hop, is often followed by a Fair. The best way to attempt to interact with high float is to get straight under her and up tilt or up air as she's coming down. If peach is floating high, sometimes we can dash through and full hop Bair through her</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Edgeguarding Peach (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Edgeguarding peach is hard, but it is possible</li>
                    <li>Peach double jump is slow, but it goes very far</li>
                    <li>If peach has access to air dodge, nair, and other threats like up air and up B, trying to jump out and shine her is not very advisable</li>
                    <li>Peach can start a high float and try to return to stage with fair out</li>
                    <li>She may try to take stage by throwing a turnip</li>
                    <li>Her mid-height recovery is best beaten with ledgehop bair</li>
                    <li>Prime goal in the edgeguard is to make her grab edge and trap her there</li>
                    <li>Early up B prevents us from jumping out and shining her</li>
                    <li>If we shine out of shield vs up B and she still has float, she is not dead</li>
                    <li>Her late up B is similar to marth. Grab edge early and roll at the proper time</li>
                    <li>If you have ledge intangibility, it is much easier to have shine work than time the roll to beat late up B</li>
                    <li>If she is below the ledge, shine Bair is probably our best bet</li>
                    <li>If she up Bs from far away, be ready to double jump Bair if she tries to take center stage</li>
                    <li>She will make us guess between stage and edge</li>
                    <li>Bair and shine are the primary tools for keeping her off stage</li>
                    <li>If peach has float, they may just double jump back and play the mid height float approach</li>
                    <li>She does not regain float for grabbing the edge, only for landing on stage</li>
                    <li>If she does not have float, drop edge → double jump is easy to beat with shine</li>
                    <li>If peach jumps from ledge drifts into stage, take the effort to ensure bair still sends her out</li>
                    <li>It is technically possible to up smash the ledge jump</li>
                    <li>Peach get up attack can reverse and send us off stage if we are not careful</li>

            <h2>Grand Ideas from Others (Billy / Fiction)</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Peach is slow and has to catch fox</li>
                    <li>Fox has low range</li>
                    <li>Peach has a decent shield and access to CC</li>
                    <li>Fox does not want to directly interact with peach</li>
                    <li>If you are next to peach in lag, something has gone wrong. It is a terrible position</li>
                    <li>Puff has a clear weakness on the ground; getting grabbed. Peach however is still really strong on the ground</li>
                    <li>Peach isn't that great at being aggressive</li>
                    <li>Peach fair is actually a zoning tool; meant to keep us out, not actually hit us</li>
                    <li>You can technically whiff punish Fair with DD grab, but it is very hard / predictive</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Float Strategy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If peach is floating: Avoid her OR Do things that force her to make hard commitments in order to win</li>
                    <li>If peach is floating low, you can full hop over her</li>
                    <li>If peach is floating high, you can run under her</li>
                    <li>Use platform to reposition and effectively avoid her until a better position presents itself</li>
                    <li>Peach's main ground threat is dash attack. Playing far away from it is easier, but gives up stage</li>
                    <li>We can try to wavedash back into up tilt while holding down to ASDI down</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>FD Specific</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Outside of the chain grab, FD is a good stage for us</li>
                    <li>On FD, everything peach does should be tailored towards getting a grab</li>
                    <li>Peach wants to get to the edge before worrying about a turnip to prevent early side B</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Neutral Game</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Peach dash attack is used to beat us dash dance camping, it is not very good for her in scrambles</li>
                    <li>Fox has 3 primary approach options / angles: From the ground (Shine, Up smash, Grab, Down Tilt), From Short hop (Nair if in the air, Drill if on the ground), From Full hop (Drill, Weak Nair if it leads to up smash kills)</li>
                    <li>Peach playing neutral should be looking to do moves to defend herself, rather than looking to chase us</li>
                    <li>Peach can play aggressive when we are cornered</li>
                    <li>Peach using full hop → double jump while having a turnip is a play to stall out invincibility</li>
                    <li>If peach is floating close enough to the ground, she can ASDI down</li>
                    <li>Peach does not want to approach with high floats</li>
                    <li>Peach wants to avoid landing in the corner</li>
                    <li>It may be best to waveshine peach all the way to the edge, especially if we know the ledge trap well enough</li>
                    <li>If she uses dash attack on our shield, we have time to wavedash down or drop shield into a shine punish</li>
                    <li>If a character, especially peach with her floats, is hit out of the air and is forced to land, they will still incur landing lag, which changes frame advantage</li>
                    <li>It is our goal to get peach to chase us the whole time</li>
                    <li>Only laser when we think she truly cannot hit us</li>
                    <li>When peach falls out of the air she has many punishing things she can do in place (Nair, down smash, jab, grab) or she can dash back</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Wait for falling Nair and up tilt her</li>
                    <li>F throw dash attack combos on DI "in" (Behind on up throw)</li>
                    <li>F throw → Dair at low % may be useful</li>
                    <li>Running shine → Full hop can still hit confirm into an aerial</li>
                    <li>You cannot fight peach when she thinks you both want to fight</li>
                    <li>You must fight peach when she is moving locations. That's when she is vulnerable</li>
                    <li>Peach's options for dealing with threats is to throw out a move, or shield</li>
                    <li>The only issue with peach is that she can't move very quickly</li>
                    <li>You can't even bait and whiff punish peach. You just have to force her to move/approach us, and beat her while she's moving</li>
                    <li>When edgeguarding, don't let her go high. Do everything we can to force her to ledge, and then just win the ledge situation</li>
                    <li>Full hop against the back of her shield</li>
                    <li>Stay in center and when she tries to push you out, counter hit her</li>
                    <li>Be far away during laser camping, but when that's over, you can dash dance pretty close to her</li>
                    <li>Raw drill is the strongest tool in neutral</li>
                    <li>If peach Fairs your shield, she has won</li>
                    <li>Generally avoid this position though</li>
                    <li>Don't challenge up B directly. We can shine oos if she up B's high enough though</li>
                    <li>She does not want to float under a platform</li>
                    <li>While running under peach and rising with bair can edgeguard peach, waiting for her to fall and using up tilt is better</li>
                    <li>Don't full hop out of the corner</li>
                    <li>Don't approach her in the corner. We are better off dash dancing and waiting</li>

            <h2>Billybopeep's Peach Rules</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Core Philosophy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your goal vs peach is to stay outside of her threat range and make her chase you then read specific actions at timings that require peach to call you out to hit you for it</li>
                    <li>When trying to hit peach floating above the stage when recovering use falling bair instead of rising bair (DJ falling bair is fine)</li>
                    <li>You can always waveshine down when waveshining peach and still get a JC Up smash or JC Grab follow up (Ex. peach smash DIs shine but you're not sure which direction)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Float Height Interactions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you're going to read peach doing middle height or full hop float you can run under it or you can full hop nair into it (Do it at timings from when she's already grounded)</li>
                    <li>Default to no fast fall FH; you should fast fall on reaction to stimuli</li>
                    <li>Don't directly challenge a peach that is already floating high in the air, you should run under it or avoid her (it's okay to whiff punish her but you have to read a specific timing)</li>
                    <li>If peach is on the ground or floating low to the ground you can dash > full drift full hop past her, down tilt or aerial in place (Don't be afraid to use your double jump and drift away/land on platform is you have to)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Fair and Approach Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You should never get hit by fair, stay outside of it's threat range or (Do actions that either are fast enough to hit peach before she fairs OR do actions on reaction to her fairing from outside of its range)</li>
                    <li>NO approaching aerials UNLESS you go far enough to full reach peach wavedash back range (Full overshoot/extremely deep ONLY)</li>
                    <li>Only laser in positions where it's impossible for you to hit peach or for her to hit you no matter what mixups are played (Threat range wise)</li>
                    <li>Being next to peach is almost always strictly bad</li>
                    <li>Don't be afraid to grab peach</li>
                    <li>Don't put yourself in lag when in peaches threat range</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>If in air about to jump: Short hop up air (as they rise!!!)</li>
                    <li>If in air already can sometimes whiff punish with drill (mostly if they take space with the move)</li>
                    <li>If spamming aerials low to ground:</li>
                    <li>Nair: attack head or behind with bair (usually if she drifts in)</li>
                    <li>Fair: Attack early with nair (if drift in)</li>
                    <li>If spamming side platform height float INSTANT fair drift in you can full hop drill it (very niche)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Drift back drill to bait a dash attack/grab</li>
                    <li>Short hop at them waveland back (ok), be ready to punish dash attacks by shielding/jumping/dash dance</li>
                    <li>Full hop on side platform they are under, options are:</li>
                    <li>Go through platform drill (meh)</li>
                    <li>Short hop off platform and go through platform/off side platform towards center and either double jump or space bair</li>
                    <li>Walk off platform into grabbing their dash dance/shield (surprisingly very good)</li>
                    <li>Go to top platform, go through/walk off platform/short hop off platform and react carefully</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If Peach in air about to jump:</strong> Short hop up air (not as good if you're in center but an "ok" option)</li>
                    <li><strong>If they TAKE space in air with aerial:</strong></li>
                    <li>Dash under and take center (better vs fair)</li>
                    <li>Drill/grab (only if you're not dead in the corner)</li>
                    <li>Roll (meh)</li>
                    <li>Run under bair (while they're mid air)</li>
                    <li>Jump to side platform</li>
                    <li>IF YOU'RE SHIELDING IN THE CORNER AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO AN AERIAL ON YOUR SHIELD, PRIMARILY FAIR, WAVEDASH TOWARDS TURNAROUND UP TILT IS AMAZING (THE LEFFEN)</li>
                    <li>If spamming float cancel low aerials, you can bair their back if they're spamming them, but mostly for drift in</li>
                    <li><strong>If they GIVE UP space in air with aerial:</strong></li>
                    <li>Dash dance closer</li>
                    <li>Jump to side platform</li>
                    <li>(Mostly just a mixup after when you take space)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Dash full hop drill/dash shine full hop drill</li>
                    <li>Jump to side platform (be careful for up air reads while you're jumping)</li>
                    <li>Shield primarily if you think they're going to dash attack you and you don't have space to run away</li>
                    <li>If cornered and Peach is playing grounded consider running shine drill</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Mostly about double jumping over them while maintaining center and bairing and short hop up airing</li>
                    <li>Be careful on Yoshi's as you can get down smashed from being under side platform</li>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Peach at Higher Percents</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you're in center you can start drift back nairing instead of drift back drill due to nair having more range</li>
                    <li>When Peach is at mid-ish percents and mid air you can start nairing her if you think she's going to remain in float for a while - follow up with up tilt etc</li>
                    <li>Grounded up tilt kills around 120ish on most stages</li>
                    <li>One spot you can use this well is when you're in shield, mainly in corner, wavedash towards up tilt works great vs grounded opponents</li>
