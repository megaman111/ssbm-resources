            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Matchup Fundamentals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's a simple matchup where we don't have to do too many things, but if we get the basics wrong, we can simply die</li>
                    <li>Fox is the faster character and can set the pace of the match. Great camper</li>
                    <li>Puff is impossible to edgeguard, and has rest</li>
                    <li>The matchup requires patience from both sides</li>
                    <li>Over lasering will get us killed. Bair, Dash attack, and pound are all real threats</li>
                    <li>Lasers function as a way of making Puff approach. It is rather effective since she can die around 50%</li>
                    <li>Some matches will go to time. Puff can choose not to interact. But once we are fighting, fox is faster</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Basic Strategy (% Based)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>When Puff is at 0%:</strong> Play safe, don't get rested</li>
                    <li><strong>When Puff is at 30%:</strong> Nair and Bair become safer, she can't CC them fully</li>
                    <li><strong>Near 50%:</strong> We start looking for ways to grab</li>
                    <li><strong>After 70%:</strong> Grab is still the best way to kill</li>
                    <li><strong>Near 80-90%:</strong> Up air raw kills, but don't force it</li>
                    <li><strong>Above 100%:</strong> Strong up tilt / down tilt, Bair and nair start to kill</li>
                    <li>If she's playing far away, shoot her. Otherwise, fight her</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Move-Based Decisions (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Our Moves</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nair / Bair are pretty viable even at 0% cause she's not likely to be CCing on the ground</li>
                    <li>Dair is really really risky. Just don't. Unless you really think they'll be on the ground</li>
                    <li>If they short hop a lot, we may be able to risk using down air more. If they full hop, we're better off using the other aerials</li>
                    <li>Back throw, especially near edge, is a big problem</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Puff's Moves</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bair:</strong> Puff wants to hit bair and nair at low %. Bair knocks down near 35% and even before then it's very hard to CC punish. We can whiff punish / fight what she does after the bair. Be more willing to play true RPS at high % than low %. It is better to attack Bair from the opposite side or below. Puff cannot bair in scrambles very well; it comes out frame 14. If puff is doing approaching bair to beat laser, we can beat it with Nair</li>
                    <li><strong>Up Air:</strong> Puff up air is a great combo move and it beats everything we have in juggle situations</li>
                    <li><strong>Forward Air:</strong> Very active and has a weak hit, but generally just a worse bair</li>
                    <li><strong>Nair:</strong> A big, lingering auto-cancel hitbox. Can't CC punish it either</li>
                    <li><strong>Dair:</strong> Very good edgeguarding tool. It can combo into rest or grab at high% (they usually grab)</li>
                    <li><strong>Pound:</strong> Knocks down early (7%) but it's only good once the other aerials are established</li>
                    <li><strong>F-smash:</strong> Built to beat full hop Bair. Her up smash out of shield is pretty good above 20%. It can lead to rest</li>
                    <li><strong>Up Tilt:</strong> Leads into rest very well. Pokes shield a lot when facing each other</li>
                    <li><strong>Dash Attack:</strong> Gives her grounded burst speed and sends at a rough angle</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>When We're at %</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Near 35%:</strong> Bair, Strong Fair, and Dash attack all knock down</li>
                    <li><strong>Near 60-70%:</strong> F smash functionally kills; Avoid it</li>
                    <li><strong>Near 100%:</strong> Up air and grab aren't really a problem</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>When Puff is at %</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>At 0%:</strong> Be very careful</li>
                    <li><strong>At 30%:</strong> Nair and Bair become safer, she can't CC them fully</li>
                    <li><strong>Near 50%:</strong> We start looking for ways to grab</li>

            <h2>Other Thoughts (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>If you're up 2 stocks to 1 and she is above 50% we can take risks that would get us rested normally</li>
                    <li>DI Behind her vs up throw</li>
                    <li>If she wavelands onto the platform you can spot dodge or shine her trying to grab</li>
                    <li>Watch out for tech trap rest</li>
                    <li>Side B is a good recovery if she cannot fair that space</li>
                    <li>Shine stalling useful for recovery as well; she can't quite cover everything</li>
                    <li>Recovering high is also useful; her double jumps are slow</li>
                    <li>Do not edgeguard. Just win on stage</li>
                    <li>Wavedash back out of shield to disengage. Stay safe</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Stages (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with Battlefield</li>
                    <li>Ban Dreamland and Fountain</li>
                    <li>Yoshis is okay, but there's less stage to camp</li>
                    <li>Stadium and FD are our counter picks</li>
                    <li>Getting rested on dreamland hurts the most. It is an aggressively campy stage</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Fiction Ideas</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Positioning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since her prime mixup when she jumps is aerial vs pound, the best place to be is directly under her</li>
                    <li>Puff Dair loses to up tilt, and if she stays up there you can bair her</li>
                    <li>If she full hops at you run directly under her</li>
                    <li>Puff can falling up air, but if we're dash dancing it doesn't work that well</li>
                    <li>Holding down in the corner is still good</li>
                    <li>It is very important not to be in the corner, though. Fight for center is very important</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Platform Play</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Puff uses the inner edge of the side platform</li>
                    <li>Wavedash off of platform allows her to get under the other platform (stage dependent of course)</li>
                    <li>She will use the inner edge of the platform to push us into the corner</li>
                    <li>Fox does not have a counter to the inner edge of the side platform</li>
                    <li>Watch out for up airs coming off of platform</li>
                    <li>When she is at kill %, she is even more likely to play the platform position</li>
                    <li>If you try to up smash a landing, she can falling up air and rest it. Do not be greedy!</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Shield & Defense</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If she is not in range to grab you, just shield her aerials</li>
                    <li>If you get a shine out of shield, it's mostly useful for taking the space</li>
                    <li>When puff is off stage, don't laser when she is very high up</li>
                    <li>Run up dtilt can pressure low ledge regrab</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Mixups & Approaches</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is a hard mixup between fast fall grab and slow fall up air</li>
                    <li>However, she often has to jump across the stage to set it up</li>
                    <li>DI low % Bair away to get to the ledge</li>
                    <li>If bair is badly spaced on our shield, wavedash forward and jab</li>
                    <li>If she lands a lot, don't bother shooting her much. Find grabs instead</li>
                    <li>Cover pound on reaction with jump off shine</li>
                    <li>Running shinegrab is good because it can lead to a grab or tech chase opportunity</li>
                    <li>We can wavedash out of shield → rising nair between full hop bair → falling bair attempts</li>
                    <li>Do not laser when she can drift and hit you</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Kill Setups</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Up throw Deep up air kills from 57% - 72%</li>
                    <li>Drill → Grab is useful. She may spot dodge the shine</li>
                    <li>Land on platforms after up throw up air if possible. It can allow for more up airs</li>
                    <li>Dash dance a lot. Threaten hitting her</li>
                    <li>Jab breaks ASDI down at 115%. Allows for jab → aerial / up smash</li>
                    <li>Use shield a lot at high % out of dash and wavedash to stay mobile</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Tech Traps</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pretty much every spacie has lost to a puff because of her tech trap on platforms, where she up-throws you and either does or doesn't up-air. If she guesses right, she gets a free low percent rest. If she guesses wrong it doesn't matter as it's very easy to react if you guessed wrong or not. There is a way to get rid of this 50-50 entirely, making it a very similar gimmick to Ice Climbers' down-throw → down-air.</li>
                    <li>It is possible on every stage, but for sake of explanation we're going to use Battlefield since the timing is the easiest to explain.</li>
                    <li>Say you are at ~12% and puff up throws you on the platform. At the apex, or slightly after, when you begin falling, you input a tech in case she does not do an up-air. This is because of how tech-trapping works. You essentially want to input the tech as soon as you are able to.</li>
                    <li>Because of how early you input this tech, you are then able to SDI her up-air up in order to waste the rest of the frames in which you are tech trapped, and can then tech her up air as well. This means that there is no longer an easy missed tech for her to rest in this situation.</li>
                    <li>Puff is not able to rest your SDI up until higher percents where you should just focus on DI'ing up-air properly anyway. In order to counter this puff has to read your tech with rest, or reaction tech-chase you with something else. This setup should no longer be a free 50-50.</li>
