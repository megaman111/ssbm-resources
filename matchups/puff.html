                <h3>Matchup Fundamentals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's a simple matchup where we don't have to do too many things, but if we get the basics wrong, we can simply die</li>
                    <li>Fox is the faster character and can set the pace of the match. Great camper</li>
                    <li>Puff is impossible to edgeguard, and has rest</li>
                    <li>The matchup requires patience from both sides</li>
                    <li>Over lasering will get us killed. Bair, Dash attack, and pound are all real threats</li>
                    <li>Lasers function as a way of making Puff approach. It is rather effective since she can die around 50%</li>
                    <li>Some matches will go to time. Puff can choose not to interact. But once we are fighting, fox is faster</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Basic Strategy (% Based)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>When Puff is at 0%:</strong> Play safe, don't get rested</li>
                    <li><strong>When Puff is at 30%:</strong> Nair and Bair become safer, she can't CC them fully</li>
                    <li><strong>Near 50%:</strong> We start looking for ways to grab</li>
                    <li><strong>After 70%:</strong> Grab is still the best way to kill</li>
                    <li><strong>Near 80-90%:</strong> Up air raw kills, but don't force it</li>
                    <li><strong>Above 100%:</strong> Strong up tilt / down tilt, Bair and nair start to kill</li>
                    <li>If she's playing far away, shoot her. Otherwise, fight her</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Move-Based Decisions (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Our Moves</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nair / Bair are pretty viable even at 0% cause she's not likely to be CCing on the ground</li>
                    <li>Dair is really really risky. Just don't. Unless you really think they'll be on the ground</li>
                    <li>If they short hop a lot, we may be able to risk using down air more. If they full hop, we're better off using the other aerials</li>
                    <li>Back throw, especially near edge, is a big problem</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Puff's Moves</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bair:</strong> Puff wants to hit bair and nair at low %. Bair knocks down near 35% and even before then it's very hard to CC punish. We can whiff punish / fight what she does after the bair. Be more willing to play true RPS at high % than low %. It is better to attack Bair from the opposite side or below. Puff cannot bair in scrambles very well; it comes out frame 14. If puff is doing approaching bair to beat laser, we can beat it with Nair</li>
                    <li><strong>Up Air:</strong> Puff up air is a great combo move and it beats everything we have in juggle situations</li>
                    <li><strong>Forward Air:</strong> Very active and has a weak hit, but generally just a worse bair</li>
                    <li><strong>Nair:</strong> A big, lingering auto-cancel hitbox. Can't CC punish it either</li>
                    <li><strong>Dair:</strong> Very good edgeguarding tool. It can combo into rest or grab at high% (they usually grab)</li>
                    <li><strong>Pound:</strong> Knocks down early (7%) but it's only good once the other aerials are established</li>
                    <li><strong>F-smash:</strong> Built to beat full hop Bair. Her up smash out of shield is pretty good above 20%. It can lead to rest</li>
                    <li><strong>Up Tilt:</strong> Leads into rest very well. Pokes shield a lot when facing each other</li>
                    <li><strong>Dash Attack:</strong> Gives her grounded burst speed and sends at a rough angle</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Near 35%:</strong> Bair, Strong Fair, and Dash attack all knock down</li>

                    <li><strong>Near 100%:</strong> Up air and grab aren't really a problem</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>If you're up 2 stocks to 1 and she is above 50% we can take risks that would get us rested normally</li>
                    <li>DI Behind her vs up throw</li>
                    <li>If she wavelands onto the platform you can spot dodge or shine her trying to grab</li>
                    <li>Watch out for tech trap rest</li>
                    <li>Side B is a good recovery if she cannot fair that space</li>
                    <li>Shine stalling useful for recovery as well; she can't quite cover everything</li>
                    <li>Recovering high is also useful; her double jumps are slow</li>
                    <li>Do not edgeguard. Just win on stage</li>
                    <li>Wavedash back out of shield to disengage. Stay safe</li>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Positioning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since her prime mixup when she jumps is aerial vs pound, the best place to be is directly under her</li>
                    <li>Puff Dair loses to up tilt, and if she stays up there you can bair her</li>
                    <li>If she full hops at you run directly under her</li>
                    <li>Puff can falling up air, but if we're dash dancing it doesn't work that well</li>
                    <li>Holding down in the corner is still good</li>
                    <li>It is very important not to be in the corner, though. Fight for center is very important</li>

            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Platform Play</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Puff uses the inner edge of the side platform</li>
                    <li>Wavedash off of platform allows her to get under the other platform (stage dependent of course)</li>
                    <li>She will use the inner edge of the platform to push us into the corner</li>
                    <li>Fox does not have a counter to the inner edge of the side platform</li>
                    <li>Watch out for up airs coming off of platform</li>
                    <li>When she is at kill %, she is even more likely to play the platform position</li>
                    <li>If you try to up smash a landing, she can falling up air and rest it. Do not be greedy!</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Shield & Defense</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If she is not in range to grab you, just shield her aerials</li>
                    <li>If you get a shine out of shield, it's mostly useful for taking the space</li>
                    <li>When puff is off stage, don't laser when she is very high up</li>
                    <li>Run up dtilt can pressure low ledge regrab</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Mixups & Approaches</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is a hard mixup between fast fall grab and slow fall up air</li>
                    <li>However, she often has to jump across the stage to set it up</li>
                    <li>DI low % Bair away to get to the ledge</li>
                    <li>If bair is badly spaced on our shield, wavedash forward and jab</li>
                    <li>If she lands a lot, don't bother shooting her much. Find grabs instead</li>
                    <li>Cover pound on reaction with jump off shine</li>
                    <li>Running shinegrab is good because it can lead to a grab or tech chase opportunity</li>
                    <li>We can wavedash out of shield → rising nair between full hop bair → falling bair attempts</li>
                    <li>Do not laser when she can drift and hit you</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Kill Setups</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Up throw Deep up air kills from 57% - 72%</li>
                    <li>Drill → Grab is useful. She may spot dodge the shine</li>
                    <li>Land on platforms after up throw up air if possible. It can allow for more up airs</li>
                    <li>Dash dance a lot. Threaten hitting her</li>
                    <li>Jab breaks ASDI down at 115%. Allows for jab → aerial / up smash</li>
                    <li>Use shield a lot at high % out of dash and wavedash to stay mobile</li>

                <h3>Tech Traps</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pretty much every spacie has lost to a puff because of her tech trap on platforms, where she up-throws you and either does or doesn't up-air. If she guesses right, she gets a free low percent rest. If she guesses wrong it doesn't matter as it's very easy to react if you guessed wrong or not. There is a way to get rid of this 50-50 entirely, making it a very similar gimmick to Ice Climbers' down-throw → down-air.</li>
                    <li>It is possible on every stage, but for sake of explanation we're going to use Battlefield since the timing is the easiest to explain.</li>
                    <li>Say you are at ~12% and puff up throws you on the platform. At the apex, or slightly after, when you begin falling, you input a tech in case she does not do an up-air. This is because of how tech-trapping works. You essentially want to input the tech as soon as you are able to.</li>
                    <li>Because of how early you input this tech, you are then able to SDI her up-air up in order to waste the rest of the frames in which you are tech trapped, and can then tech her up air as well. This means that there is no longer an easy missed tech for her to rest in this situation.</li>
                    <li>Puff is not able to rest your SDI up until higher percents where you should just focus on DI'ing up-air properly anyway. In order to counter this puff has to read your tech with rest, or reaction tech-chase you with something else. This setup should no longer be a free 50-50.</li>

                    <li>The big myth is that it's realistic for Puff to consistently escape the second hit with good SDI - this is simply not true</li>
                    <li>Escaping a deep upair requires Puff to hit two full SDI inputs within a three-frame window in the correct direction</li>
                    <li>Maximum theoretical human success rate is somewhere between 20% and 33%, but in practice it's much lower even at top level</li>
                    <li>Most instances of successful SDI you see are single inputs versus shallow upairs</li>
                    <li>Most times a Fox hits a deep upair, the Puff fails to hit two SDI inputs and eats the second hit</li>

                    <li><strong>70%:</strong> Upthrow upair becomes guaranteed to kill on Dream Land</li>
                    <li><strong>67-72% on Dream Land:</strong> A pummel gets Puff to guaranteed kill percent. This is your reliable window on Dream Land</li>
                    <li><strong>Above 72%:</strong> Upthrow upair becomes less reliable; consider single-hit upair timing instead</li>
                    <li><strong>~90%:</strong> Single-hit upair should never true combo if Puff DIs upthrow properly</li>

                <h3>Execution Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't tack on extra percent unless absolutely necessary (if Puff has lead and refuses to touch ground)</li>
                    <li>The higher Puff's percent, the harder it becomes to true combo upthrow into upair before Puff can jump out</li>
                    <li>To get deep upair at higher percents, initiate your double jump as close to the apex of your full hop as possible</li>
                    <li>Consider clawing to do faster upairs after a higher double jump - this allows you to double jump later while maintaining good drift</li>
                    <li>Focus on placing your upairs as deep as possible into Puff's hurtbox</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Practice Regimen (UnclePunch Training Mode)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Go into Combo Training as Fox vs Puff</li>
                    <li>Set DI Behavior to "Random DI"</li>
                    <li>Set SDI Behavior to "Always SDI"</li>
                    <li>Set Post Hitstun Action to "Invincible"</li>
                    <li>Set Puff to 57% and practice until it becomes subconscious</li>
                    <li>Gradually increase percent bit by bit until consistent at 72%</li>
                    <li>If Puff SDIs out, a competent human would likely have SDI'd out too</li>
                    <li>If Puff becomes invincible and jumps out, you didn't true combo</li>
                    <li>If Puff dies, there's a very good chance a human Puff would also have died</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Grab Optimization Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Practice from dash dance:</strong> Simulate actual game situations where you're dash dancing to shark Puff's landing</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on jump cancel grab:</strong> It has less forward momentum than dash grab, preventing overshoots. Also useful: boost grab for range</li>
                    <li><strong>Hold forward + c-stick upthrow:</strong> If you whiff the grab, you automatically get optimal DI on Puff's very quick upthrow. No downside to this habit</li>
                    <li><strong>Pummel timing:</strong> If you pummel, there's a 1-frame window after pummel for guaranteed throw. Use both control stick and c-stick with slightly offset timing to maximize odds of hitting it</li>
                    <li><strong>Transition to claw during grab:</strong> If you hit a roadblock at 70%+, practice transitioning to claw grip during the grab for faster upairs</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Stage Considerations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Battlefield/Fountain of Dreams:</strong> 19% window for reliable upthrow upair kills (57-76%)</li>
                    <li><strong>Dream Land:</strong> 6% window for reliable upthrow upair kills (67-72% with pummel)</li>
                    <li>Dream Land is less scary than previously thought - you can still reliably land upthrow upair at kill percent, just with a smaller window</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Drill is a great combo starter vs grounded Puff as you can true combo into grab/up tilt/jab</li>
                    <li>Drill shine and grab are good vs crouch</li>

                    <li>Be sure to not shine when you can get higher reward follow-ups</li>
                    <li>Shine is still a good move when it's a running shine or a pressure sequence</li>
                    <li>Running shine is really good at catching Puff drifting away</li>
                    <li>Shine can be a really good tech chase but if you aren't confident in your tech chases just hold center otherwise you get reversaled hard</li>
                    <li>Shine grab is great</li>
