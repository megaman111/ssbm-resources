                <h3>Percent-Based Knockdown</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>At low % she can't knock us down; CC a bunch</li>
                    <li>She wants a stack of needles. Big %</li>
                    <li>She wants to hit us with up tilt</li>
                    <li>Her spaced aerials can't be CC punished usually. It's free damage for her</li>
                    <li>Using shield well by reacting to her jump forces her to empty land grab</li>
                    <li>At low % (~20%) both dash attack and down smash begin to knock down</li>
                    <li>Nair knocks down near 35%</li>
                    <li>Fair/Down tilt knocks down near 40%</li>
                    <li>Weak nair (keeps us from juggling) knocks down near 60%</li>
                    <li>To contrast, most of Fox's moves are fairly % independent</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>General Strategy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fox is the flexible character</li>
                    <li>Play far away horizontally, attack her landing if she jumps</li>
                    <li>Platforms help her move, but grab game is weaker there</li>
                    <li>Our Nair and Bair are better to hit her on platforms for stray hits cause she can't CC</li>
                    <li>Down tilt and up tilt are useful for juggling, but they get shield grabbed</li>
                    <li>Her bad drift and bad down air lead to easy juggles</li>
                    <li>Punish her landing with dash attack and grabs</li>
                    <li>True CC vs dash attack is good. Dair / Nair / Bair in place are also good vs lunge attacks</li>
                    <li>Fox is really bad at ~80%. For sheik, everything is a kill threat</li>
                    <li>She can use needles, airdodge, platforms, SDI, and slow vs fast fall to make things much harder for us</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Dealing with Sheik's Options</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If she's using aerials, Nair/Bair/Up tilt / Up air them</li>
                    <li>If she's primarily grounded and playing near the edge: Leave</li>
                    <li>If they are grab based, they will boost/CC grab more</li>
                    <li>Her rolls are long and pretty good. So is her shield drop up air</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>By Percent Range</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>0-30%:</strong> Up throw up air works</li>
                    <li><strong>30-65%:</strong> Platform tech chases become important</li>
                    <li><strong>65-85%:</strong> Up throw up air becomes less reliable, focus on positioning</li>
                    <li><strong>85+%:</strong> Kill setups available</li>
                    <li><strong>Note:</strong> Port 4 makes these things easier. Pick it. Fight for it</li>

            <h2>More Concepts (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Platform Tech Chases</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>On platforms, tech chase with up air</li>
                    <li>Nair out of shield is too strong; shield pressure careful</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Neutral Game</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lasers are good but lose to boost grab. Be careful!</li>
                    <li>At 0% fox wins a lot. It is very important to not waste that advantage</li>
                    <li>If they are spaced, ftilt and dtilt are not punishable on shield. Sometimes we can up smash, but usually, we would need to roll away or something</li>
                    <li>Against up tilt, we should CC grab oos (Hold down, hold shield, mash A)</li>
                    <li>Fair jab pressure? CC grab that too!</li>
                    <li>To punish down smash we could up smash out of shield, or waveshine</li>
                    <li>Waveshine out of shield can punish aerials</li>
                    <li>Practice avoiding needles on recovery</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>DI & Survival</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When grabbed at low % use slight DI behind using Up + Back</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Beat double jump fair by refreshing on time</li>
                    <li>Stand up while she's poofing</li>
                    <li>If she shortens, you may have to read it with a roll</li>
                    <li>Shine bair can prevent her getting to double poof spacing</li>
                    <li>If she makes stage, standard getup → waveshine across stage can be good</li>
                    <li>Sometimes she can air dodge; that can be hard to beat</li>

            <h2>Stage Selection (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>We strike battlefield and fountain of dreams</li>
                    <li>She picks between Yoshis / Dreamland</li>
                    <li>We like FD / Stadium</li>
                    <li>Flat stages with less platforms is worse for sheik</li>
                    <li>If they like yoshis, they are likely to be an "aerial / f tilt / down smash / up tilt type sheik</li>
                    <li>If they like dreamland, likely to be more of a tech chase / live longer more defensive style</li>
                    <li>Sheik will counter pick to battlefield, maybe fountain if they're more "scrambles" type sheik</li>
                    <li>FD is our best stage, but pokemon stadium is a close second. The platforms on PS are good for her though</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Other Ideas from Billy and Fiction</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Combo Game</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When sheik is without a double jump, you can combo more horizontally</li>
                    <li>Sometimes staying on platform during sheiks invincibility is better than dropping to the ground</li>
                    <li>Rising bair → up tilt on platform can work, but not until like 50%</li>
                    <li>Up throw up air is unreliable vs sheik at low-mid%</li>
                    <li>If you nair against sheik, do one of the following: land behind her, or land in front and shine</li>
                    <li>Up tilt can start a platform tech chase at mid %</li>
                    <li>As sheik is falling near edge, turn your back to the edge</li>
                    <li>It is best to late bair when doing shield drop bair on top of people</li>
                    <li>Drill grab in the corner, especially vs characters without a shine</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Neutral Strategy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When sheik is further than "yoshis" distance away, you can just laser</li>
                    <li>When she's close enough, run her over with 3's like its yoshis</li>
                    <li>Since sheiks struggle with CC at low %, don't jump unnecessarily</li>
                    <li>Only jump at sheik when you've established that she should be grounded</li>
                    <li>When your invincibility ends, don't be in the corner / in a gimp-able situation</li>
                    <li>Don't really fight sheik in the corner</li>
                    <li>Need to have ideas of hot and cold</li>
                    <li>Sheik is kinda scared of perma-hot fox, but it's still not great</li>
                    <li>Play safer until you think they think you'll be safe, and then they get used to taking space, then hit them a bunch</li>
                    <li>Never let them be prepared for the type of play you're putting forth</li>
                    <li>If you can convince them that aggressive behavior is okay, they will be easier to hit</li>
                    <li>Press in until there is a 2-3 second time period where you can't hit them</li>
                    <li>We want the sheik to feel awkward and confused</li>
                    <li>We want to win off of outplays, rather than mixups</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Platform Play</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>She can't directly approach top/side platform</li>
                    <li>If you are near the ledge, always throw sheik off stage</li>
                    <li>Up throw up air works around 25-30%</li>
                    <li>Shine low and bair before she can grab the edge</li>
                    <li>If grabbed near the ledge, we can DI on reaction to down throw vs forward throw</li>
                    <li>Short hop up air under her shield on platform can work, but getting directly under her and using up tilt can be better</li>
                    <li>She does not deal with things directly below her that well</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>When Sheik is Falling from High Off Stage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is good to look like you want to hit her, even if you don't. Just short hop randomly; she may double jump out of fear</li>
                    <li>Sheik's full hop is strong, but rising aerial is punishable</li>
                    <li>To beat sheik's full hop, sometimes you need to short hop under her and nair, rather than full hop and meet her in the air. She's too skinny sometimes; this seems safer</li>
                    <li>It is better to stand still than wavedash and put yourself in lag while sheik is on ledge</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Platform Situations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can crouch under platform and she has to do stuff to beat it</li>
                    <li>Sheik shielding on platform is kind of a stalemate, but if you let her shield drop for free, it's also a problem</li>
                    <li>If sheik is going to platforms a lot, you can often try to just full hop up air her as she's rising to the platform</li>
                    <li>On yoshi's, she will hit top platform on no/slight DI, so don't use up throw up tilt under top platform</li>
                    <li>If she's big chilling on a side platform: Shoot her!</li>
                    <li>Sitting and crouching can be good at low %. Make sheik make a decision</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Ledge Play</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you're spaced for ledgedash tilt, you're vulnerable to ledgedash dash attack / boost grab</li>
                    <li>You have to already be running forward to punish her aerials</li>
                    <li>If you want to DD grab an aerial, you must read drift and fast fall timing</li>
                    <li>Drive by vs sheik. Don't stay close</li>
                    <li>Against bad sheiks you can run away and they'll chase you</li>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Effective Sheik Mixups (Done on the 3)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>These are all done at the same range. Cross up nair, full hop mix, running shine should all be done to get around basic F-tilts</li>
                    <li>Ensure acting on 1,3, and 5. Even number actions are easy for her to counter</li>
                    <li>When using shine bair to edge guard, consider slow falling to mess with their timing</li>
                    <li>If you're coming down and sheik is at low %, you're better off getting to ground and trying to play a 3 than falling with bair</li>
                    <li>Dash momentum → Full hop out of F-tilt range and fade back so she can't tell what side you'll be on</li>
                    <li>With the way sheiks jump works, you "can" react to her jumping and assume whether she will fast fall or not</li>

                    <li>If you get hit with 3 hits of dsmash, you may be able to shine oos if you DI'd into range</li>
                    <li>If you get hit with 4 hits of down smash, you have to hold that</li>

                    <li>Use full hop because it allows you to directly engage with a wide variety of outcomes with the possibility to react</li>
                    <li>If you think sheik will run in you can: drill and dash back (done pre-emptively to confirm if she did dash forward)</li>
                    <li>If you're both dashing forward fairly close to each other, consider running and crouching to center</li>
                    <li>Part of the sheik ledge dash mixup is to get behind the ledgedash using dash dance only</li>
                    <li>Full hop double laser → Fall through platform laser is better than running into the corner and lasering</li>
                    <li>If fox full hops at sheik, she has a chance to fair and just win</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Sheik has to pre-emptively f-tilt at Nair spacing</li>
                    <li>When they do not have time to F-tilt they may shield or dash back</li>
                    <li>If we have to move out of the way of f-tilt, we do not have time to punish it</li>

                    <li>She cannot sweetspot from below the ledge, so they will be looking to up B from above if possible</li>
                    <li>To deal with boost grab (and possibly also dash attack), full hop is better than dashing back</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>You will never whiff punish sheik on reaction. If you look for an opening on reaction, you won't find it. Instead, force her to react to you. Don't react to her</li>
                    <li>The standard "3" is a medium dash in, a short dash back, straight into an instant approach</li>
                    <li>Running shine → waveshine → up throw → tech chase on platform using up air and regrab if it misses</li>
                    <li>If she's near 10% on battlefield, if you up throw her, waveland up tilt can be very useful in tech chases on platform</li>
                    <li>Stay grounded. Do not approach with a full hop. A full hop 3 may be allowed, but overall, prefer to win with dashes</li>
                    <li>If she is jumping a lot, find up air or up tilts under her</li>
                    <li>Do not scrap with sheik. Drive by and get out. 1 scrap at a time</li>
                    <li>Do no jab. They will CC grab and kill you</li>

                <h3>The 1-3 Mixup Pattern</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a basic mixup pattern that Fiction proposes for playing Fox against Sheik in neutral</li>
                    <li>You do not want to fight Sheik when you can't do this</li>
                    <li>The 1 and 3 come from counting how many times we dash dance before we attack</li>
                    <li>A "1" is just running in and attacking</li>
                    <li>A "2" would be dashing away, then dashing in and attacking</li>
                    <li>A "3" would be dashing in, then dashing away, then dashing in and attacking</li>
                    <li>3 is the most powerful against Sheik - almost everything you do should be a variation on the 3</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>The 4 Attack Options</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you do attack and dash in on Sheik, you have 4 options</li>
                    <li>There is nothing that Sheik can do to cover all 4 of these options</li>
                    <li>When you threaten her with one of these 4, she's gonna get antsy, and she'll probably do an ftilt or wavedash back</li>
                    <li>She has to do something to deal with it, but she can't deal with all of them</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Don't React - Make Sheik React</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The big mistake many players make is that they want to dash in, dash out, and then react to what Sheik does - this is the wrong mentality</li>
                    <li>Always force the Sheik to react to your option</li>
                    <li>If you play against Sheik and say "I'm gonna bait them" and dash back and watch the Sheik, by the time you see the ftilt it's too late to punish it</li>
                    <li>She is borderline impossible to punish on reaction</li>
                    <li>Sheik's walling with ftilts and fairs is actually very vulnerable, but you can't punish it on reaction</li>
                    <li>But Sheik has to do something to deal with this big mixup Fox has, and if she doesn't she's gonna get run over</li>

                <h3>How to Execute the 3</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The 3 generally looks like a medium-length dash in (give Sheik something to react to) followed by a short dash back, then a dash in and instant attack</li>
                    <li>You don't want to try to react</li>
                    <li>If Sheik throws out a move, the dash back will give you just enough timing mixup to beat her</li>
                    <li>Once they catch on a little and start to wait, the 1 starts to work really well</li>
                    <li>Because Sheik can't cover everything, Fox ends up with a favorable mixup</li>
                    <li>Anything Fox does Sheik can technically punish him for, but Fox has like 10 things that kill Sheik if they work</li>
                    <li>She can only kill Fox if she guesses correctly which of those 10 things Fox is going to do</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Fiction's Mental Approach</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When Fiction plays a Sheik he just asks "Will I do a 1 or a 3? I'll do a 1. What'll I do after the 1? Running shine."</li>
                    <li>He doesn't actually pay attention to the Sheik player</li>
                    <li>The more you pay attention the more you'll try to react to what Sheik is doing, and the more you'll lose</li>
                    <li>She's the only character where it's worse if you try to play neutral against her</li>
                    <li>You can't say as Fox, "I'm gonna wait for you to make a mistake," because that's what Sheik wants</li>
                    <li>Fox wants her to constantly feel like Fox is rolling the dice and throwing out a move - which you should, because that's the hardest thing for her to deal with</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>Sneaky 3 (Full Hop Attack)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fiction calls dash in full hop attack a "sneaky" 3</li>
                    <li>You move in with the dash in, then you move out of Sheik's threat range temporarily with the full hop over her, then you try to hit her</li>
                    <li>It's the same concept of Fox threatening and Sheik having to respond, then immediately punishing her after her response</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Aerial Selection</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Clown nairs" are basically just Fox nairs that are kind of just mindless rushdown nairs</li>
                    <li>It's hard for Sheik to deal with Fox just jumping in with a nair, and Fox gets to clip her a lot of the time</li>
                    <li>Fox's short hop dair in neutral is not as good against Sheik, because she's kind of skinny</li>
                    <li>She will frequently pop out of the dair and grab Fox even without really good SDI</li>
                    <li>Drill tends to be better as a whiff punish, because the dair in neutral leads to Fox getting grabbed a lot of the time</li>
                    <li>Dair in neutral will mostly be limited to the full hop portion of the mixup, where Fox can react to Sheik's response and whiff punish her with the drill</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>Updown Lasers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If Fox wants to start a match with lasers, he should do what Fiction calls updown lasers</li>
                    <li>This just means drop through the platform with a laser, then full hop double laser back onto the platform, and repeat</li>
                    <li>This can be infuriating for Fox's opponent, and is a good tool for Fox when he's not feeling very aggro</li>
                    <li>He doesn't want to react to Sheik, but can just avoid her entirely using platforms</li>
                    <li>Typically Fox wants to use these lasers to get Sheik to reach a point where 1 is unreactable, and at that point you have your 1 and 3 mixup pattern</li>
                    <li>The only thing Sheik can do about this is standing needles, which requires a hard read</li>
                    <li>If Sheik commits to trying to needle Fox on the platform, Fox can just choose to run under her platform and up air her instead of continuing to laser</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Fiction notes that if Sheik is spacing around Fox's wake up shine and grabbing to punish the whiffed shine, it means they're grabbing Fox late and giving him actionable frames. Wake up shine is an execution test, not a decisionmaking test.</li>
                    <li>If they're waiting for wake up shine, they're not actually comboing you, they're winning neutral on wake up. Fox can start doing mixups - you can spot dodge, roll, waveshine, drill, dash - you're effectively playing neutral.</li>
                    <li>You shouldn't view grabbing the wakeup shine as the Sheik covering something, you should view it as a hole in their punish.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>If you find yourself getting stuck in the corner, it's very good to just go to ledge. Sheik just loses her corner pressure at that point because she can't actually chase you to the ledge well.</li>
                    <li>In those scary corner situations she's just going to wait and try to react to you, but Fox can just go to ledge and ledge dash off and there's nothing she can do. Or double jump laser land on the side platforms, what's she going to do about it? Her pressure in the corner is an illusion.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>When Sheik dthrows Fox around 100%, Fox can DI full away and miss tech, then try to Amsah tech. Sheik can basically only dsmash, and Fox gets a 50/50 on late vs early dsmash.</li>
                    <li>Because they're trying to reaction tech chase you, they'll probably do late dsmash. The only other thing they can do is early dsmash, but then you can start mixing in tech behind and live longer.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>When Fox up throws Sheik to the platforms, he can cover tech in place with fullhop instant upair and react to the techroll after.</li>
                    <li>If Fox upairs Sheik's roll, she can slide off DI, so it's often better to up air the tech in place and tech chase with grab or up tilt if Sheik doesn't tech in place.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Out of grab, Fox should always up throw upair. Sometimes they will SDI which might make Fox feel like he should bair, but you still should upair.</li>
                    <li>It will work 90% of the time even against Sheiks that SDI, since there are still timing and spacing mixups Fox has. Sheik spamming jump will often get caught, and overall the outcomes from upair are much better for Fox than for Sheik.</li>
