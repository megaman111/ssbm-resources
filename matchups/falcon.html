                <h3>Understanding the Matchup</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Key to the matchup is understanding when we are faster</li>
                    <li>Falcon's short hop goes way further than ours, and his aerials out of short hop are better too</li>
                    <li>Falcon has good aerials for keeping fox out; Nair, Bair, and Dair are all useful</li>
                    <li>Falcon can run faster on the ground as well</li>
                    <li>It is similar to fighting against Marth's dash back, but falcon is worse in the corner</li>
                    <li>Hit falcon when he is moving forward</li>
                    <li>Falcon's ground options are weak, and his recovery is also weak</li>
                    <li>Falcon's spot dodge is bad, his roll is just okay, out of shield in general is weak, and ground game is just jab and grab since his tilts are also bad</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Falcon's Plan</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Falcon's plan is largely to: Do an aerial, Reposition with dash, Do another aerial</li>
                    <li>This will be mixed with jab, shield, and CC to prevent predictability</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Overview of Falcon's Moves (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Knee:</strong> The big threat. Avoid getting hit by it</li>
                    <li><strong>Up Air:</strong> Great juggle tool and combo starter</li>
                    <li><strong>Bair:</strong> Good spacing tool</li>
                    <li><strong>Nair:</strong> Fast, good for scrambles. After seeing a Nair, try to position to cover a stomp or another Nair</li>
                    <li><strong>Dair (Stomp):</strong> Combo starter, leads to knee</li>

            <h2>More Ideas (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>You can choose to laser falcon, but his speed makes that pretty dangerous</li>
                    <li>Falcon gets easier to kill the more % he has</li>
                    <li>Falcons will either likely look for raw grab or stomp, or focus on stage control by using things like up air, bair, or f tilt</li>
                    <li>Dash dance grab can be hard for falcon to control, but CC grab is a problem for us</li>
                    <li>Down throw is a good throw for falcon, but back throw and f throw are pretty bad overall</li>
                    <li>Corner him, cover roll, cover full hop, beat Nair. Go in if they are cornered</li>
                    <li>The scary edge guards come from down throw or strong aerials</li>
                    <li>Avoid gentleman → Knee. Tech the gentleman!</li>
                    <li>Nair → F tilt from Falcon gets strong at knockdown %</li>
                    <li>When they are trying to approach, retreating bair/nair (very slightly retreating)</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="matchup-content">
            <h2>Combo Game (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Combo-ing falcon is hard at low %</li>
                    <li>Beat attempts to DJ to edge with shine or by grabbing edge at that moment</li>
                    <li>It is important to hit falcon for air dodging onto stage before he lands and gets his jump back if possible</li>
                    <li>Look out for double jump up air. Edge guard is mostly roll to the edge, DJ Bair until he dies</li>
                    <li>If they go low, just shine or bair again</li>
                    <li>Up tilt, up smash, up air are always pretty good</li>
                    <li>Falcon can slide off vs platform tech chase up air</li>
                    <li>If our dash attack is a threat, it seems like this worries falcon. This is presumably at high %</li>
                    <li>Cover tech in place with shine. Seems like often better reward than grab, and an easier reaction</li>
                    <li>Watch out for wake up jab and wake up roll, they're his best options</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Don't tech in place too much, we can get kneed for it, and it's pretty destructive</li>
                    <li>Get slide off when possible vs down throw at edge. Clip the edge and grab the edge</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>At low % we get a tech chase from back throw</li>
                    <li>You cannot chase falcon. He is faster than us</li>

                    <li>Crouching in neutral makes aerials reactable or avoidable</li>
                    <li>Falcon hits us by punishing a commitment</li>
                    <li>Edgeguard with Bair, don't grab edge</li>
                    <li>F throw very good near edge</li>
                    <li>Waveshine → dtilt → nair → shine = very strong gimp setup at mid %</li>
                    <li>Nair can be CC up smashed at low %</li>

                    <li>As long as you're out of range of the first hitbox of nair you can shield on reaction to falcon jumping and never get hit (Falcon can play empty land mixups instead of aerialing)</li>

                    <li>No short hopping at falcon (unless he's in the corner or shielding). All of your short hops should either be in place (to cover run up grab or bair him flying across the screen)</li>
                    <li>No fast fall full hop is your default full hop option</li>
                    <li>No short hopping/shining in scrambles (You should shield and dash)</li>

                    <li>Spotdodge ONLY on reaction to him being airborne (If you want to avoid run up grab i think you should roll instead)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>If falcon can double jump to ledge or air dodge to stage, there is no consistent kill</li>
                    <li>If he cannot double jump to ledge, he should be dead</li>
                    <li>If you try to f smash him on the way down and you miss, you will get counter hit and likely die</li>
                    <li>Roll to ledge, and if they can't double jump to ledge, you can cover everything</li>
                    <li>You can try run off rising nair as they drift to ledge, but its unreliable</li>
                    <li>React to the height where they up B, hit them accordingly</li>
