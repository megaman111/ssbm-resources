                <ul>
                    <li>There are two primary forms Fox can play</li>
                    <li>Falco also has two primary forms</li>
                    <li>Mango is the prime rushdown/aggressive form, PP/Ginger/Fiction are more control based</li>
                    <li>Falco wants to lock us down with laser, shield pressure, shine/Dair → cutscene → edgeguard → Dair/Bair</li>
                    <li>Fox wants to stop falco from doing all of this; Avoid it all</li>
                    <li>Fox is worse at high risk / high reward. Better to be the lower risk player as fox vs falco</li>

            <h2>Dealing with Lasers (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Anti-Laser Strategy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Falco's weak spot is up in front of his face. Abuse it with full hop and coming down with Bair / Drill / Up air depending on %</li>
                    <li>We want to be close enough to force him to protect himself with hitboxes in place. This means he cannot laser, which is the prime goal</li>
                    <li>If you can hit him when he tries to set up lasers again, that can be a big win</li>
                    <li>Nair / Bair can beat lasers, but CC shine can be an issue. Therefore, running shine can be best, depending on stage position</li>
                    <li>Fullhop approach can beat some lasers in place, and fullhop in place beats approaching laser</li>
                    <li>Running in with shield can beat stationary bair / up tilt along with the run up up smash</li>
                    <li>With run in established, full hop gets stronger</li>
                    <li>To counter the evasive style, Falco will start to jump in with more aerials to take control</li>
                    <li>Shield and take laser both very important for the evasive form</li>
                    <li>It is important not to be predictable on defense. Rolls and wavedash away need to be options, but used sparingly</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Punish Game (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Combo Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Similar to comboing fox, but he goes higher on up throw, so he hits top platforms earlier. This can make platform tech chases easier/possible at lower %</li>
                    <li>Chaingrab is notably different due to weight (Falco is heavier than fox)</li>
                    <li>Falco is harder and more dangerous to tech chase than fox. However, he is "easier" to edgeguard</li>
                    <li>Stray aerials are common openers - get used to converting from them</li>
                    <li>Drill grab is harder, but still useful</li>
                    <li>Always respect Dair, more so with falco than fox</li>
                    <li>Falco's double jump is better than Fox's. Goes higher, faster (acceleration things)</li>
                    <li>Punish his landing; he will either do nothing or laser land</li>
                    <li>Do not juggle too hard, it is easy to get reversaled</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Edgeguarding (Fox Deconstructed)</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Edgeguard Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If falco is near the edge shielding or if they just spot dodged, it should be hard for them to get back to true neutral</li>
                    <li>Fullhopping over his wakeup can beat many panic options</li>
                    <li>Things that beat take laser → dash back lose to take laser → up tilt</li>
                    <li>Falco side B is faster than fox's and it's a meteor. Thus, they will side B more</li>
                    <li>We must avoid double jump dair as a counter to edgeguards. We can use full hop bair or shield → shine to punish it</li>
                    <li>The things that lose to double jump dair beat shine stall → double jump to edge. Adapt accordingly</li>
                    <li>If they are doing more shine stall, go down and get them, or take edge. Don't keep being afraid of DJ dair if they aren't using it</li>
                    <li>Falco is more likely to up B if our back is turned</li>
                    <li>Falco ledgedash is OK but not a big time threat</li>
                    <li>Force falco to do things other than ledge hop double laser, but don't stress about punishing it every time</li>
                    <li>Shine kills are more valuable at early % (more reward for the risk)</li>
                    <li>To beat ledge hop side B, we must win while it's moving or get the landing lag</li>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Defensive Options</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Powershields are tough due to fox shield being small</li>
                    <li>When in full run, we can try sliding powershields into up smash or grab</li>
                    <li>Hold shield on low % dair shine. Not worth challenging directly</li>
                    <li>SDI Dair Down. Goal is to hit the ground earlier. Use the C stick as well</li>
                    <li>After 40%, DI in a lot</li>
                    <li>When we get grabbed we should hold UP and eventually even SDI UP</li>
                    <li>If falco uses down throw, DI away</li>
                    <li>While recovering, be ready to get lasered</li>

                <h3>Stage Choices - No Right Answers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Final Destination:</strong> We get the chaingrab, but they get crazy combos & laser control</li>
                    <li><strong>Battlefield / Dreamland:</strong> Both parties like it. Space / Control style prefers those stages</li>
                    <li><strong>Yoshi's / Fountain of Dreams:</strong> Smaller stages for those who prefer scrambles. Our down air and up tilt are both more useful with these stages</li>
                    <li><strong>Pokemon Stadium:</strong> Falco counterpick. Chaingrab is weaker, but lasers are still strong. Ban it unless you struggle a lot with platform lasers (ban dreamland), or you struggle with walling moves like bair/up tilt (ban smaller stages)</li>

            <h2>Other Ideas (Fiction and Billy)</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Additional Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hitting a falco with multiple up tilts at low % can cause a tech trap</li>
                    <li>On tech rolls during a platform tech chase, take note of up smash / F smash DI mix</li>
                    <li>Falco is so heavy that an up air near 100% doesn't even kill. Just bair, especially if they have no jump</li>
                    <li>Running shine isn't that good vs Falco. Nair and drill are better approaches</li>
                    <li>Using drill while on a platform is pretty safe and hard for either spacie to interact with</li>
                    <li>If there is space between you and there isn't a laser: Running powershield → Full hop or short hop drill is good</li>
                    <li>Run up → shield → grab can also be good</li>
                    <li>It is good to full hop over falco when the chance arises</li>
                    <li>Take laser → Dash Back → Run back in</li>
                    <li>If we are close to Falco, our aerials are pretty oppressive once Nair knocks down</li>
                    <li>Falco can be aggressed upon with run up shield / short hop drill / short hop nair in his face</li>
                    <li>When you feel like the Falco NEEDS lasers to stop you, that's the goal</li>
                    <li>Forward facing nair can be good for beating side B</li>
                    <li>Do not chase Falco vertically</li>
                    <li>On platform stages on no DI, up throw short hop up air is much better than up tilt</li>
                    <li>Fox loses most situations where he tries to interact directly with Falco</li>
                    <li>Falcos like to jump → shine → waveland on a platform. We can drill them for it sometimes</li>
                    <li>We do not want to fight falco on the platforms</li>
                    <li>Rising shine to the platform is pretty bad. No good wins. Even if it hits, it's not that useful</li>
                    <li>Play with your back turned to Falco as often as possible. Bair and up tilt are really big and hard for Falco to get through</li>
                    <li>Falco is better to down smash (on ledge?) but it's still not good to use vs either spacie. Down angled F-tilt is often prescribed as better</li>
                    <li>When you F-throw Falco off stage, the mixup involved</li>
                    <li>If you see a Falco falling from his doubles jump, we would want to fullhop to land on top of them landing</li>
                    <li>Up smash is good at low % because we can get a tech chase, and good at high % for kills</li>
                    <li>Take laser → Jab or shine is good when you will leave laser stun close to Falco</li>
                    <li>Interact as indirectly as possible</li>
                    <li>Cannot punish whiffed aerials with dash attack because they will be holding down and press the trigger for L cancel, leading to a tech in place shine opportunity</li>
                    <li>Trying to up tilt vs side B is tough and largely unadvisable</li>
                    <li>Turn your back to a Falco on the ledge</li>
                    <li>Don't directly interact with Falco on a platform. Don't even try to hit him</li>
                    <li>If Falco is shielding straight under you, it is a good time to come down with something</li>
                    <li>Primary goal is to get Falco to throw out a defensive / walling move, and dash in / grab / hit him</li>
                    <li>If falco approaches by jumping off a platform, dash dance and grab the aerial</li>
                    <li>Running through Falco during invincibility (or any time, probably) is very dangerous</li>
                    <li>Fox cannot let Falco dictate situations; if we do, we will get hit by random reads eventually</li>
                    <li>Falco is similar to peach in that they will protect themselves with a hitbox most often</li>
                    <li>Once the laser is out, the situation is reset</li>
                    <li>If the falco does laser → crouch, it can beat powershield laser → wavedash in</li>
                    <li>If the options are to shield or jump, the right answer is to fullhop to platform</li>
                    <li>If falco goes to a platform, we cannot pressure him</li>
                    <li>You can loop disengagements, but both sides can choose to engage</li>
                    <li>Do not only play the game after a laser is out. It is a losing matchup that way</li>
                    <li>If you don't like a situation, leave (usually, with full hop)</li>
                    <li>Wavedash in vs Falco is usually bad</li>
                    <li>Falcos are likely to full hop while in the corner</li>
                    <li>Falco has a tough time scrapping due to his slower jump squat. But if falco sets up the scrap, he can win</li>
                    <li>Falco likes to defend on the inner edge of platforms on the ground</li>
                    <li>If you have Falco in the corner, apply pressure without breaking the tension</li>
                    <li>FH Bair vs approaching laser should never work vs a good falco</li>
                    <li>At high % back throw can put them on platforms for tech chases</li>
                    <li>Do not contest falco in the air. If you see him there, he's already won</li>
                    <li>SDI Up on shine can work on FD, and leads falco to have to combo differently than standard shine → Dair</li>
                    <li>Runoff shine stall → react to side B beats full length side B</li>
                    <li>All down airs except the latest are technically possible to shine oos</li>
                    <li>If you see a shine, the spacie has to jump. Play around that fact</li>
                    <li>You can try to cover double laser from edge, but ledgedash will hit you</li>

                    <li>Use platforms to avoid lasers when there's nothing Falco can do to hit you</li>

                    <li>In neutral your goal should be to either hit falco out of his first laser or to avoid it</li>
                    <li>When close to falco your goal should be to pressure falco for as long as you can</li>
                    <li>Fox being next to falco IN GENERAL is an advantage</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Full Hop Spacing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are two approaching full hop spacings. One that covers falco dashing away and staying in place (closer initial spacing) and one that covers falco moving towards you and in place (further initial spacing)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The 3 Range Gameplans</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>NEAR POINT BLANK:</strong> If you get lasered in this range you are extremely close range and are in falco's immediate threat range meaning you have to play a SCRAMBLE... a.k.a A MIXUP that involves either shielding or using grounded options like [take laser jab] or [take laser shine] NO JUMPING OR DASHING ALLOWED</li>
                    <li><strong>OUTSIDE OF FALCOS THREAT RANGE:</strong> Here you cannot get hit without falco playing an aggressive mixup (approaching aerial or approaching laser) at this range you almost exclusively want to take laser. Powershielding still good. By taking laser you have essentially all of your aggressive threats available while also being able to make defensive decisions [Dash back, up tilt]</li>
                    <li><strong>TOO FAR TO GET HIT:</strong> In this range you should shield or jump over every laser as there's no way for you to actually hit falco out of 1 mixup</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>Platform Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't attack falco when he's on a platform (Unless you will end up out of range of any shield drop option)</li>
                    <li>Don't attack under a platform when he's on a platform (general rule, this is a real read to make that could kill falco; HIGH RISK)</li>
                    <li>Don't attack onto a platform when he's under it (general rule, this is a real read to make that could kill falco; HIGH RISK)</li>

                <h3>Approaching</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A trick to make approaching feel less scary is to consciously take advantage of land-canceling Falco's down air when you're below knockdown %</li>
                    <li>You have more than enough time to punish with shine before Falco even lands</li>
                    <li>Shine is the easiest option but up smash, up tilt and grab can all work depending on how long Falco has left in the air</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Goldilocks Zone</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>IBDW jousts to get into the Goldilocks zone vs Mango - close enough to hit him for lasering but not so close to be overwhelmed by preemptive aerial threat</li>
                    <li>He plays towards the outer limit of that, likely due to Mango's aggressive tendencies</li>
                    <li>Vs the same usual "good" lasers that are either impossible or 1f to power shield, dash back power shield is super easy</li>
                    <li>You can represent dash back PS into wavedash into Falco shine/up tilt etc, full hop, or just keep playing neutral</li>
                    <li>Can immediate dash nair/up smash as a laser read</li>
                    <li>Can show backflip/full hop with bair threat (seems pretty obnoxious for Falco to deal with on its own)</li>
                    <li>Can always position/reposition to set up an annoying take laser turnaround up tilt</li>
                    <li>This seems like a fairly ideal position to fight lasers on the ground, potentially erring closer vs players less likely to dash short hop at you</li>

                <h3>Dealing with Up Tilt / Bair</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The moment Falco turns around, dash up smash is an incredibly strong option as it destroys up tilt and bair</li>

                <h3>Using Platforms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using side platforms well is extremely useful vs Falco</li>
                    <li>One of the more useful ways to get on them is to full hop up air onto them</li>
                    <li>Players like IBDW will often full hop nair onto the side platform before immediately threatening hold shield vs immediate shield drop</li>
                    <li>Full hop up air is slightly slower, but has such high reward at low to mid %s that it's worth trying out</li>
                    <li>If you hold shield for a moment before wavedash OOS off a platform, it's a nice natural timing mixup vs people trying to call out your run off aerial (usually an up tilt)</li>
                    <li>Just don't hesitate too hard or you'll lose to their second attack</li>
                    <li>Aerial on platform → immediate shield drop bair is really useful</li>
                    <li>If they miss a down hold near the ledge you usually combo them to death, preferably into a below ledge shine</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>Dash in → take laser → turn up tilt is a real valid answer</li>
                    <li>At some spacings / timings you may be able to take laser and CC dtilt</li>
                    <li>Take laser → dash back → up smash can also work vs certain laser → Dair attempts</li>
                    <li>"Lord stomp" "Zhu Dair" using our up air can also work. Dash back, backflip back in, up air</li>
                    <li>Dash in and up smash at the right spacing to beat bair & up smash after his back is turned</li>
                    <li>Hold shield for a moment before wavedashing out of shield off of a platform for a good timing mixup</li>
                    <li>Full hop Nair interacts well with their short hop Dair. Hits his head on the way up</li>
                    <li>Fullhop under platform → fall back through the platform → up tilt under the platform can bait and punish shield drop attempts</li>
                    <li>At low %, waveshine up smash is likely the best outcome. Dtilt is unreliable at low %</li>
                    <li>Running shine up smash is very important to catch tech in place when in full run in a position where shine sends to the edge</li>
                    <li>You can SDI Dair up to get on a platform sometimes</li>
                </ul>
