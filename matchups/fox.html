            <h2>Neutral Game</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Core Philosophy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In neutral we have the choice between high risk and low risk options</li>
                    <li>Judge whether the other fox is looking for big hits, or baits</li>
                    <li>"Attacking in the fox ditto is not that good"</li>
                    <li>We want to get the other fox to overextend into us, and then we punish them for it</li>
                    <li>Goal is to stay on the ground. Fox is fast on the ground</li>
                    <li>The fox who wants an interaction to happen is likely at a disadvantage unless something has happened in neutral to corner the other fox</li>
                    <li>You want neutral to last longer because then you have more chance to outplay</li>
                    <li>Do not commit in positions that feel even</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Movement & Positioning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you're not "doing anything" your position still needs to be dynamic</li>
                    <li>Do not play at a certain range; try to move around and look for certain ranges you can take advantage of</li>
                    <li>Need to be 50% disinterested in the opponent. Occasionally just…feel like going to some other position</li>
                    <li>Remember that you can move in a random direction irrelevant to the opponent's position</li>
                    <li>If the battle doesn't look immediately winning, you can do some sort of safe, tricky movement and see if the new position yields better odds</li>
                    <li>Step 1 - Get safe. Step 2 - start moving in tricky ways to find a way in</li>
                    <li>Use movement rather than actual moves to prevent fox moving forward</li>
                    <li>Do not do more than 1 thing in place. You must use his dash to create ambiguity</li>
                    <li>If we can dash dance around basic approaches / distance, we can whiff punish aerials</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Drill</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fadeback drill is a nice option to hold space with</li>
                    <li>Fadeback drill → Dash forward beats waiting</li>
                    <li>Fadeback drill → Jab or Dash back or Shine can beat whiff punish attempts</li>
                    <li>Drill in place will beat majority of running shine approaches</li>
                    <li>To beat a fadeback drill you need to play the mixup after - are they going to dash forward? dash back? full hop?</li>
                    <li>Answers could be up smash, overshoot running shine, up air/nair, respectively</li>
                    <li>Drill → Shine → Wavedash → Dash → Let dash finish → React</li>
                    <li>Drill grab is good, but do not reach with drill. Drills should be done in place. If you want to reach, reach with late nair</li>
                    <li>While fadeback drill is good for preventing things like running shine, it is not a good approach. Don't do it</li>
                    <li>If you're getting drilled a lot: shield more</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Full Hop</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full hop is really good in neutral because Fox isn't naturally going to be prepped to beat it like say a Falco, so he'll have to read it if he wants to win the situation</li>
                    <li>Out of full hop you can fadeback drill, waveland back, double jump, shine → waveland on platform</li>
                    <li>Full hop fadeback drill is especially good because it's essentially the same situation as a normal fadeback drill only you have more time to play a mixup out of the full hop</li>
                    <li>It takes some time to set up and for that reason shouldn't be spammed but instead should be used in tandem with a short hop drill/up smash to beat Foxes who like to get real close to punish a landing</li>
                    <li>Fullhop is strong on tri-plat stages because it gives access to platforms</li>
                    <li>Conversely, the lack of having access to all of the above options is why fullhop is significantly worse/riskier on FD</li>
                    <li>Before using fullhop, opponent should be buttered up; very ready to commit</li>
                    <li>Fullhopping over a fox that's coming down is stronger than trying to grab their landing</li>
                    <li>If you do a non-dash fullhop, it's pretty likely you just need to get out to the top platform</li>
                    <li>Shine OOS, dash dance grab, and Fullhop over the other fox are the 3 things that actually work to outplay the opponent in the ditto</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Shine</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If we want to be the faster, more aggressive fox, running shine is clearly good</li>
                    <li>Shine dair is a decent approach, especially if it hits. Can set up for a tech chase</li>
                    <li>If the running shine is likely to miss, shine nair, shine → fullhop, or going into a wavedash may be better than drilling</li>
                    <li>Shinegrab is very good on shield</li>
                    <li>Don't shine any closer than inner platform edge on Battlefield</li>
                    <li>Running shine should be something that happens after extended neutral, more as a last resort</li>
                    <li>If you sense they like to running shine, use up tilt if your back is turned, and drill in place if facing forward</li>
                    <li>Shinegrab into the corner is good, but not great. If the shine hits, they just get edge anyway</li>
                    <li>Wakeup shine dair to beat people waiting to punish waveshine lag</li>
                    <li>If you whiff an aerial, don't shine. Keep moving</li>
                    <li>Use CC shine vs approaching nair / FH bair</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Grab</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Run in grab works once run in shine is established</li>
                    <li>Raw grab is a strong whiff punish; can beat shield, and maybe shine</li>
                    <li>Beat up tilt spam with DD grab / upsmash</li>
                    <li>Nair → grab is really strong at low %</li>
                    <li>If they shine out of shield a lot, it means that they shield a lot. Grab them</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Aerials</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use fadeback aerials to prevent fox from coming in</li>
                    <li>Retreating Bair is best used against aerial approaches</li>
                    <li>If they are approaching a lot, bair, nair, and up tilt become very useful</li>
                    <li>Nair is a good air to air</li>
                    <li>If you use nair, it should be late nair, especially into the corner</li>
                    <li>Attacks in place make the opponent want to whiff punish</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Lasers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Laser → Wait. Don't shoot more than 1 laser</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Platform Play</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>After double jumping to the top platform, we need to waveland down, rather than wavelanding off automatically. It is too easy to counter</li>
                    <li>Do not attack directly from the top platform. We need drill grab; we're not getting it from up there</li>
                    <li>The only good approach from the top platform is to short hop off the platform, and fastfall through the side platform</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Percent-Based Neutral</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>At 0%:</strong> We have 3 moves that work: Shine, Dair, and Grab</li>
                    <li><strong>At 5%:</strong> Up Air starts to knock down, therefore FH falling up air is on the table</li>
                    <li><strong>At 20%:</strong> Dtilt and Up Tilt become useful; they knock down. Up Air 2 on its own also useful near 20%</li>
                    <li><strong>At 35%:</strong> Strong Nair and Bair knock down and become useful for keeping the other fox away</li>
                    <li><strong>At 60%:</strong> Even weak nair and bair knock down</li>
                    <li><strong>At 100%:</strong> Aerials start to kill, Up smash kills, Dash attack → Tech chase up smash becomes good</li>
                    <li>At 100%+ smart foxes will shield even more to beat the dash attack; grab them</li>
                    <li>When you are at low % vs a high % Fox, play even safer</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Combo Starters & Extensions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Up tilt beats falling drill, and even a trade makes for a great combo</li>
                    <li>Waveshine dtilt is strong</li>
                    <li>Waveshine up smash beats DI up on thunders' combo</li>
                    <li>Wavedash in up tilt is good under these conditions: Dash dance is at stalemate, You can convince them to chase you slightly after dashing away, The space has been maintained and you think they will close the distance</li>
                    <li>Weak reverse bair is a great DI mixup, allowing for combos into up smash or hard bair. At "worst" you will likely get a tech chase</li>
                    <li><strong>Note:</strong> Upsmash is very good at low % but gets worse near 20-30%. DI away gets hard to chase</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>If you can always throw fox off stage. Forward and back throw are both good, and largely lead into 50/50s for the edgeguard</li>
                    <li>If you can confirm that they want to DI off a platform to either get to top platform or get off stage, back throw up smash / tech chase should work</li>
                    <li>Up throw → Fast fall → Laser Land / Waveland becomes a kill confirm on side platform</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>0-40%:</strong> You should just up throw</li>
                    <li>If they DI towards the edge/offstage, shine them, or maybe Fthrow them offstage</li>
                    <li><strong>Near 40%:</strong> If they use no DI, up tilt</li>
                    <li>Regrab DI away until 66% where Fair / soft Bair knock down → tech chase</li>
                    <li>Probably pivot grab both slight DI. DD grab might work too</li>
                    <li>Only need pivot up smash for no DI. Slight DI can be DD up smashed</li>
                    <li><strong>Above 66%:</strong> Upthrow → Fair → RTC until up throw up smash kills</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>If up thrown to platform, ensure you mix up your techs</li>
                    <li>On stages with platforms, up throw up tilt is largely bad</li>
                    <li>At low% reading tech in place on platforms with rising up air is good</li>
                    <li>Up air can shield poke on yoshis; it can poke feet on platforms</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Can we get to edge before them? If so take the edge. The fox wants the edge, especially using side B to get there fast. Prevent this if possible</li>

                    <li>If we can't prevent them from getting the ledge first, we simply leave</li>
                    <li>Dash attack → grab edge is true. Do not let them side b to edge with no double jump</li>
                    <li>Largely, the goal is to funnel them towards an armada shine</li>

                    <li>Look to use down angle ftilt or dsmash on reaction to side B to the edge</li>
                    <li>After using bair against side B and once it's established and they start to use shorten side B, use late stand</li>

                    <li>If you are in shield, a prime option is to wavedash back to create space, and then go into dash dance</li>
                    <li>If you use shine out of shield to counter someone that is fast fall → L cancel-ing, they will tech, and likely will tech in place</li>
