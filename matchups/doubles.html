                <p style="font-style: italic; margin: 0 0 1rem 0; font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8;">Note: While these concepts apply broadly to doubles play, they are especially valuable for Fox players due to Fox's speed, versatility, and central role in most team compositions.</p>
                <p style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.8;">This is a collection of all the information I think is really important if you want to take a deep dive into a comprehensive approach to teams. Teams is a complicated but really fun mode with a lot of nuances that at first seem random but can be made less random with good awareness and coordination.</p>
                <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.8;">It should also be noted that a good singles player will only amplify their skill as a doubles player. Simply being able to hold your own in singles neutral and then also having these concepts in your pocket will help you excel with many types of teammates.</p>

            <h2>Key Differences: Singles vs Doubles - NMW</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Neutral Game</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Singles:</strong> There is no way to be a remotely good singles player without an excellent understanding of neutral game - it's possibly the most important and probably the most difficult part</li>
                    <li><strong>Doubles:</strong> If you are playing a support role in doubles, it's possible to win playing no neutral game whatsoever</li>
                    <li><strong>Singles:</strong> About a dance to jockey for advantageous positioning - you play patient and find your spot, then take your punish as far as it goes</li>
                    <li><strong>Doubles:</strong> About trying to create situations where your opponents have no options whatsoever</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Escape Options</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Singles:</strong> Besides wobbling and a few chaingrabs, you can pretty much always do something to escape situations</li>
                    <li><strong>Doubles:</strong> There are countless situations where there is absolutely nothing you can do</li>
                    <li>If you are playing against a team that isn't on point about capitalizing on overextensions to create their own "100-0" situation, it's worth playing risky and aggressive</li>
                    <li>Most teams are not on point about turning reversals into no-win situations</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Situational Understanding</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Singles:</strong> Situational understanding is probably the most important thing, but there is little consensus on this</li>
                    <li><strong>Doubles:</strong> Situational understanding is by far and away, unequivocally the most important thing to playing doubles</li>
                    <li><strong>Singles:</strong> There are objectively and obviously best situations</li>
                    <li><strong>Doubles:</strong> Has a lot of situations where you have alternative options that are all good, and it's not clear what to do - learn these ahead of time</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Risk/Reward</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Because you have a partner to back you up, the risk/reward of certain options is completely different from singles</li>
                    <li>Because the logic of which options are good in singles doesn't necessarily make sense in the context of doubles, you really need to figure out things ahead of time</li>
                    <li>Coordination is paramount, so you and your partner need to be on the same page about which options you favor in which situations</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Improvisation vs Flowcharts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Doubles:</strong> Much more about improvisation and much more free flow than singles</li>
                    <li><strong>Singles:</strong> Lets you get away with camping into flowchart punishes if you are good at staying safe and have good execution</li>
                    <li>Simply because there are innumerable situations with 4 players on the screen compared to 2, doubles forces countless novel situations which you need to learn to navigate</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Time Management</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time is the most important resource in doubles</li>
                    <li>Earning time to look at the entire screen in order to assess where to position yourself is a victory in itself</li>
                    <li>Learn which situations allow you to take advantage of the time you've earned</li>
                    <li>Don't squander advantages you've gained by choosing options that take too much time</li>
                    <li><strong>Waiting is bad</strong> - doubles favors being proactive far more than singles</li>
                    <li>If you don't feel the urgency when you are playing, odds are that you have poor situational awareness</li>
                    <li>There's almost always useful things to be done on the screen</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Screen Awareness</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to watch the screen while watching or playing doubles is a skill to be learned</li>
                    <li>You need to develop the ability to track all four players simultaneously</li>
                    <li>This is fundamentally different from singles where you primarily focus on your opponent</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="matchup-content">
            <h2>Doubles for Singles Tryhards - NMW</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section" style="background: #e8f4f8; border-left: 4px solid #667eea;">
                <p style="font-style: italic; margin: 0; font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8;">In a community largely composed of motivated young individuals who strive to climb to the peak of the mountain, investing time in doubles often seems like a diversion. Being a good doubles player involves a different skillset, but honing your doubles skills can result in improvements in singles as well. If you struggle with any of the following things, playing doubles will accelerate your growth as a singles player, probably even more than playing singles.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Fighting in Close Quarters / Microspacing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Teams, especially on Yoshi's, involves a shitton of hitboxes delicately spaced around both your opponent and teammate</li>
                    <li>If you are antsy when people enter the edge of your range, this will quickly vanish from playing some good sessions of teams</li>
                    <li>Your "bubble" is constantly violated, and you need to learn your hitboxes, their hitboxes, and how to drift/pivot/etc.</li>
                    <li>If you watched G3 GF, HMW+Phil talk about how Armada vs. Leffen matches tend to be played at mid and long range, but Mango vs. Armada was all being played at close range</li>
                    <li>If you suck at close range, play teams</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Making Decisions Quickly</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Situations arise much more quickly in teams - opportunities are fleeting</li>
                    <li>In singles, you often camp in neutral, find your spot, then do your rehearsed punishes</li>
                    <li>Teams has way more situations and infinitely more improv</li>
                    <li>You will learn to recognize situations and to react quickly by practicing teams</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Being Slippery and Not Getting Locked Down</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Whenever your teammate dies, you need to be slippery</li>
                    <li>Moves have frame commitments, but movement doesn't necessarily</li>
                    <li>Watching good doubles players like PewPewU, you can see how slippery they manage to be to avoid getting crushed in 2v1 situations</li>
                    <li>If you are one of those people who consistently throws out moves at the same ranges instead of opting to maneuver around situations, playing teams, and especially 1v2, will immensely help you</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Seeing Opportunities for Crossups</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Watch how PewPewU creates offense with crossups in 2v2</li>
                    <li>Watch how he does it in 1v2 situations</li>
                    <li>In the same vein as how you will learn to maneuver better, you will learn to smell the right time for crossups</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Getting Out of the Corner</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's very rare for you to get lucky and get out of the corner in teams</li>
                    <li>Rolling in generally doesn't work</li>
                    <li>Dashing aerials are likely to get punished by the back line</li>
                    <li>You have to get real good to reclaim stage position unless you can ledgedash like Hax</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Getting Your Moves Out on the Earliest Possible Frames</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>As mentioned before, singles has a lot of neutral</li>
                    <li>Teams has a lot of "heads up" situations where you try to throw out your move to beat your opponent's</li>
                    <li>Getting your moves out as quickly as possible is super important</li>
                    <li>You will learn to react to whiffs and hits on shield, as well as hit confirms because you need to get subsequent moves out quickly as well</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Dealing with Crouch Cancel</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crouch cancel is annoying - grabs tend to beat it, but sometimes grabs are not a good option</li>
                    <li>Learning how to space your moves and move quickly out of them to avoid getting CC punished is huge in teams</li>
                    <li>If you play a team without a spacie, CC can wreck your day if you aren't cognizant of it</li>
                    <li>You'll get really good at anticipating and playing around CC playing one of these compositions</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Ledge Tech Skill</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Melee is a game played at the ledge</li>
                    <li>Control of the ledge is way more important in teams than in singles</li>
                    <li>More of teams is going to be played at the ledge</li>
                    <li>You will be forced to ledgedash, refresh invincibility, and so on to reclaim stage position</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Getting Out of Shield</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shielding is better in teams because there are way more situations where grabs aren't threatening</li>
                    <li>Not only does this result in you being in shield more, but you have to figure out how to get out in more challenging situations</li>
                    <li>You can have your roll cutoff while you are getting shield pressured, or you can have two people sandwiching your shield with hitboxes like spacie uptilts, staggering their shieldstun</li>
                    <li>Shield way too much in singles? At least you'll learn to escape quickly from teams practice</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Shield Angling / Shield DI / Light Shielding</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>As mentioned, you'll be in shield a lot more</li>
                    <li>Using these defensive techniques goes from being a nice helpful bonus to something essential as fuck</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Mashing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You gots to get outta grabz or else u gonna get fukt</li>
                    <li>Teams will force you to develop your mashing game</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Reading Techs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tech chasing with regrabs or things that slowly rack up damage is not a good idea in teams</li>
                    <li>Going for a hard punish based off a tech read is better the vast majority of the time</li>
                    <li>It's also easier to read techs in teams because more options are cut off</li>
                    <li>Think of it like training wheels - you'll do it a lot more, and it'll be a bit easier, so then you'll be primed to do it when necessary in singles</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Anticipating Recovery Options / Ledgeguarding from the Stage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Closing out ledgeguards as quickly as possible is important - protracted ledgeguards are bad</li>
                    <li>You want to do a 1-2 step ledgeguard, not 5+ steps</li>
                    <li>Therefore, reading and going for the coup de grace is better</li>
                    <li>In spite of this, going offstage is often risky, so you'll also learn to force people onstage and to ledgeguard them there</li>
                    <li>Note: People tend to do this too much rather than not enough, but it's still a valuable skill</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Recovering with Randall</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>People go for Randall way more because the ledge is always covered</li>
                    <li>Learn the timer, learn to use him, learn to stop people from using him</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Ledge teching 10 times, v-canceling, etc. are pointless a lot of the time in singles because they just reset you to a ledgeguard that anyone decent will hit</li>
                    <li>If you Falcon kick after getting hit off at 100, you can keep living until 170, but you don't gain any height most of the time</li>
                    <li>Still, getting more chances is never a bad thing - in doubles, it's a SUPER good thing</li>
                    <li>You'll get better at living longer, and depending on which ledgeguard options your opponent opts for, you might even get to turn it around on them off a ledge tech</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Hitting multiple targets, especially when you are unsure of how many you will hit, only happens in doubles and against ICs</li>
                    <li>How this helps should be obvious</li>

                <h3>Knowing When to Get Nana (The Answer: You Probably Shouldn't as Much as Commentators Say)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Target selection is another thing that's only relevant against ICs</li>
                    <li>"Always go for Nana" is bad advice - go for Popo when it's a guaranteed kill</li>
                    <li>It's easy as fuck to knee ICs out of their side+b if it's only Popo</li>
                    <li>Popo's recovery without Nana is seriously Falcon caliber</li>
                    <li>In teams, you are often put in situations where you need to decide whether to ledgeguard or give it up and do something across the stage</li>
                    <li>Like when facing ICs, it's usually better to go for the guaranteed thing across the stage (team save, team combo is like killing Nana) but sometimes you go for the kill on your side</li>
                    <li>It'll make it easier for you to decide when not to go for Nana, which is the default option</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Don't cross over or stand on your teammate, and don't go for things they are already accomplishing</li>

                    <li>Don't hold or push someone to ledge when your teammate needs it</li>
                    <li>Don't throw away a stock to try to save someone who has a very slim chance of coming back (remember, each team has 8 stocks they share)</li>
                    <li>Don't try to use moves to defend yourself or use moves as panic options</li>
                    <li>Don't overextend because you don't trust a teammate to do something</li>

                <h3>Understanding Neutral in Doubles</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The doubles neutral game is similar to singles - it's about adjusting positioning to force an opening on the opponents</li>
                    <li>The fight for positioning while keeping risk/reward in mind for both you and your teammate is what makes up doubles neutral</li>
                    <li>The tools you use to achieve solid positioning will vary by character and team composition, but should always be something you look to improve and understand</li>
                    <li>Teams awareness goes a long way towards decision making for achieving good position</li>
                    <li>Think of your neutral game as a combined goal for you and your teammate - your neutral isn't separate</li>
                    <li>Your goal and gameplan should ideally function as a unit with your teammate</li>

                <h3>Why Center Stage Matters</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Controlling center stage is the first thing that can truly give you a huge advantage as a teams player</li>
                    <li>Center stage allows you to box the other team out</li>
                    <li>You can reach your teammate quicker from center</li>
                    <li>Center allows you to abuse space more effectively</li>
                    <li>Increases survivability as a team</li>
                    <li>Makes doubles a much more structured format than you might be accustomed to</li>
                    <li>Every single good team will be thinking about how to take center and be very cautious of leaving that space</li>
                    <li><strong>Most important: Controlling center gives you a CHOICE in the gamestate</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The "Roll Distance" Rule</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep about a roll distance away from your teammate as a general rule of thumb</li>
                    <li>This spacing depends on how much space the character needs, but it's a good baseline</li>
                    <li>This is often referred to as maintaining your "side"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Key Rules for Teammate Spacing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Almost NEVER cross over your teammate</strong> - there are exceptions, but in general let your teammate keep their position</li>
                    <li>This reduces confusion because it keeps your position structured and productive</li>
                    <li>Close enough to assist your teammate but far enough to give them the space they need</li>
                    <li>If you stay too close, your teammate can't comfortably interact with the situation</li>
                    <li>If you are too far away, you cannot assist them or damage control if they start being punished</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Advanced Spacing for Sandwich Combos - NMW</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The optimal spacing for sandwiching is roughly one Pokemon Stadium Pokeball width apart</li>
                    <li>This distance allows both players to hit the sandwiched opponent without hitting each other</li>
                    <li>At this spacing, you can use short hop aerials that drift toward the opponent</li>
                    <li>Spacies can shine after aerials at this distance, making it especially effective</li>
                    <li>The sandwiched opponent has very limited escape options at this spacing</li>
                    <li>Adjust spacing based on the opponent's percent - closer at low percent, farther apart at high percent</li>
                    <li>Be aware of moves with large hitboxes that might hit your teammate</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Maximizing Damage in Sandwich Situations - NMW</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When sandwiching, alternate attacks to keep constant pressure</li>
                    <li>Use moves that knock the opponent toward your teammate, not away</li>
                    <li>Short hop aerials are ideal because you can drift and adjust spacing mid-attack</li>
                    <li>Don't both attack at the same time - this wastes hitstun and can cause you both to get punished</li>
                    <li>The goal is to build percent quickly until you reach knockdown percent</li>
                    <li>Once you have knockdown, you can start true team combos</li>
                    <li>Fighting opponents at 0% is difficult due to crouch cancel, so sandwiching to build percent is crucial</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Platforms allow you to stay safer when facing a lot of danger, such as spawn invincibility or an unfavorable 2v1</li>
                    <li>Platforms become important when facing characters that are slower or can't challenge them as well</li>

                <h3>Top Platform Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The top platform is much like the top of the key - on top platform you can truly control the gamestate</li>
                    <li>You can access every position on the stage in a reasonable amount of time</li>
                    <li>Can stop high percent team combos as they usually occupy the height of the top platform</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Damage control is positioning that allows you to disrupt a beneficial situation the opponents might have</li>
                    <li>Keep in mind which moves you use and the timings - some moves are much better and lower risk</li>

                    <li><strong>Projectiles are the most prominent damage control tools</strong> - they disrupt with usually no repercussion for using them</li>
                    <li>The negative of projectiles is they can be blocked</li>

                    <li>Some of the best damage control by the ledge is just not getting involved</li>

                    <li>In general, you want to abuse the weaknesses of each type of character</li>
                    <li>Sandwiching every composition is not always a good idea</li>

                    <li>Punish columns describe positioning during a team combo</li>
                    <li>A team combo generally has the victim go back and forth between teammates while rising in height</li>
                    <li>This relates back to letting hitstun breathe - you have more time than you think</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Start close to your teammate at lower percent to pass them back and forth</li>
                    <li>Get farther apart as the percent gets higher</li>
                    <li><strong>No two teammates should hardly ever be in the same column</strong></li>
                    <li>Horizontal combos are generally much safer and easier to execute than vertical ones</li>

                <h3>Understanding Knockback Stacking</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This topic is important to recognize during a team combo</li>
                    <li>Knockback stacking is necessary to understand for team combos and getting pick-ups on punishes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>How Knockback Stacking Works</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Within 10 frames:</strong> Moves that hit within 10 frames of hitstun starting will send with the knockback of the latest move hit</li>
                    <li>Applications are mostly for saving (using a weak move to save from Puff's rest) or combo extension with the weak move's hitbox</li>
                    <li><strong>11 frames and onwards:</strong> Moves that hit 11 frames and onwards after hitstun starting will stack the vectors of the moves</li>
                    <li>This lets you do stacking shenanigans to extend combos or hit harder than you normally would if you plan for the stacking</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>Knockback Canceling - NMW</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When two moves hit within 10 frames of each other, the second move's knockback completely replaces the first</li>
                    <li>This can be used to save teammates from powerful moves by hitting them with a weak move</li>
                    <li>Example: If your teammate gets hit by a strong move that would kill them, you can hit them with a weak move within 10 frames to cancel the knockback and save them</li>
                    <li>This is especially useful for saving from Jigglypuff's rest or other high-knockback moves</li>
                    <li>The key is timing - you must hit within that 10-frame window for the knockback to be replaced</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Advanced Knockback Stacking Applications - NMW</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>After 10 frames, knockback vectors add together rather than replace each other</li>
                    <li>You can use this to extend combos by hitting at angles that complement each other</li>
                    <li>Example: A horizontal hit followed by an upward hit can create a diagonal trajectory that's harder to DI</li>
                    <li>Stacking can also be used to kill earlier by combining multiple strong hits</li>
                    <li>Understanding the timing and angles is crucial for maximizing damage in team combos</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>This is the most difficult part of teams punish without discussing it with your teammate beforehand</li>
                    <li>With no prior communication, it's very difficult to know who will take the in-place options without overlap</li>

                    <li>You can decide you will be the "tech chaser" for a couple of reasons:</li>
                    <li><strong>Character:</strong> Speed and grab range give more leniency</li>

                <h3>Why Grabs Are Essential</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grabs are just as essential if not more so in doubles</li>
                    <li>Shielding is a really good defensive option in doubles - it allows stalling for time while holding a position</li>
                    <li>Light shield can make it difficult to get shield pokes or push them to a more favorable spot</li>
                    <li>Shielding allows their teammate to help them by hitting their shield to force you to give up the punish or shield</li>
                    <li>Because of this, grabs become much more important to keep opponents from gaining these advantages</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Grab Applications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many situations where grabs lead to kill confirms or nuanced situations like grab release</li>
                    <li>Generally grab is the single best way to prevent someone from keeping that position</li>
                    <li>There are no options defensively that beat grab other than avoiding it (not including using a hitbox)</li>
                    <li>If you want to force someone away from ledge, grab forces them to give up that position by avoiding it or being grabbed and thrown away</li>
                    <li>Grabs are generally the safest option in a 2v1 to guarantee a kill confirm</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Hold Times and Kill Confirms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hold times are relatively long, especially at higher percents</li>
                    <li>There are a lot of true kill confirms from holding someone</li>
                    <li>Most character's grabs tend to be low risk and low commitment</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Grab Release - NMW</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grab release is a good situation to keep in mind</li>
                    <li>If a teammate is holding someone while facing the ledge, hitting them with a move causes a grab release</li>
                    <li>The person who was grabbed is sent away at a downward angle</li>
                    <li>This is especially good against fastfallers, as they fall further down and have a hard time recovering</li>
                    <li>This can be done with any move but is especially good with low percent moves and projectiles</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Forced Grab Releases - NMW</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can force a grab release by hitting the grabbed opponent with specific moves</li>
                    <li>The grabbed opponent will be sent in the direction they were facing when grabbed, at a downward angle</li>
                    <li>This is particularly effective near the ledge for edgeguarding setups</li>
                    <li>Weak moves and projectiles are ideal for forced grab releases as they don't risk breaking the grab too early</li>
                    <li>Timing is crucial - hit too early and you might save them, hit at the right time and you set up a devastating edgeguard</li>
                    <li>Characters with fast, weak moves (Fox jab, Falco laser, Sheik needles) excel at forced grab releases</li>
                    <li>This technique is especially powerful in 2v1 situations where you can guarantee the setup</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Grab Hold Strategies - NMW</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Holding an opponent in grab creates a temporary 2v1 situation</li>
                    <li>The longer you hold, the more time your teammate has to position for a follow-up</li>
                    <li>At higher percents, hold times increase significantly, giving more setup time</li>
                    <li>Use pummels strategically - they add damage but reduce hold time</li>
                    <li>Communicate with your teammate about when you'll throw or release</li>
                    <li>Holding near the ledge while your teammate charges a smash attack is a guaranteed kill setup</li>
                    <li>Be aware of the opponent's teammate position - they may try to interrupt</li>

                    <li>If the goal is to pass to your teammate, make sure to grab in the direction for the better passing throw if given the option</li>
                    <li>Example: At higher percent you want to pass with Fox backthrow instead of forward throw to avoid the deadweight, making it easier for the teammate to pass them back</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>At really low percents, you might want to do a quick move after your throw to build percent so they don't fall out of the combo</li>
                    <li>Example: You might consider upthrow upsmash with Fox first before passing so that a fastfaller would not fall to the ground too fast before trying to pass at zero percent</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>For all throws, as soon as the throw starts you gain 8 frames of invulnerability</li>
                    <li>This especially comes in handy when holding someone "hostage" and the opponent trying to help their teammate is predictable</li>
                    <li>This is useful when you get a grab knowing you might be punished - you can use the throw invulnerability to protect yourself</li>
                    <li>The person you grabbed still has a chance to be hit by that move during your invulnerability</li>
                    <li>Faster grabs are much better due to every grab giving 8 frames of invulnerability</li>
                    <li>The closer the grab is to 8 frames long, the higher ratio of invulnerability the throw will have</li>

                    <li>One of the more subtle parts of teams is understanding grab states</li>
                    <li>There are two states of when someone is grabbed in Melee:</li>
                    <li><strong>Air grab:</strong> When the character grabbed does not have their feet touching the ground</li>
                    <li><strong>Ground grab:</strong> When the character has at least one foot touching the ground</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Why Grab States Matter</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Certain moves act differently to an opponent depending whether they are in the air or on the ground</li>
                    <li>Example: Fox's up tilt on Captain Falcon (grounded) will knock him out of the grab and over Fox's head</li>
                    <li>Example: Fox's up tilt on Jigglypuff (aerial) does not cause the grab to break because they are in the air during the grab</li>
                    <li>This is because Fox's up tilt has more base knockback on a grounded opponent compared to an aerial opponent</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Percent is NOT a factor for if someone will break out of a grab from a hit</li>
                    <li>ONLY the move staling and the base knockback of the move itself determine this</li>
                    <li>Some characters will always end up in a grounded state when grabbed</li>
                    <li>Other characters are dependent on who they are grabbed by</li>
                    <li>The grabber height, the grabbee height, and the grab itself all play a role in what happens</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Some throws, especially at higher percents, can cause the person being thrown to have a hitbox and collide with other players</li>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Three Types of Team Edgeguards</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>One person onstage, one person on ledge</li>
                    <li>One person going offstage, one person on ledge</li>
                    <li>Both players onstage, but one covering ledge</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>One Person Onstage, One Person on Ledge</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most traditional edgeguard and the most consistent</li>
                    <li>Holding ledge and forcing someone onstage is invaluable due to most characters having a period of vulnerability when landing onstage</li>
                    <li>Characters that take time offstage are much more vulnerable to characters on the ledge</li>
                    <li>Allows the team to cover every option with a ledge roll and a hitbox onstage</li>
                    <li>Allows the easiest time preventing the opponent's teammate from coming to assist</li>
                    <li>The person onstage can wall the teammate while the person on the ledge takes over the edgeguard</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>One Person Going Offstage, One Person on Ledge</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A little riskier but is usually better for quicker kills</li>
                    <li>Prime example: A shine spike attempt - one of the fastest kill confirms offstage but requires a commitment</li>
                    <li>Ideally the person on the ledge comes up from ledge and protects the person who went offstage</li>
                    <li>Most likely the best option when taking a stock is very crucial to the state of the game</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Both Players Onstage, One Covering Ledge</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Very rarely better than the other two, but there are advantages</li>
                    <li>Most likely the least risky option but is also the easiest to avoid</li>
                    <li>This option is the easiest to set up in a short amount of time</li>
                    <li>Example: Peach is slow but can make up for it by having one of the best ledge covering moves into a strong move</li>
                    <li>This position allows for quick readjustments if needed</li>
                    <li>Better for characters with poor ledge options</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Percent-Based Edgeguard Strategy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How low the percent of the person being edgeguarded is can affect what method you use to edgeguard them</li>
                    <li>Because time is so valuable in doubles, if given the option you should choose to get an edgeguard as quickly as possible with the resources your team has</li>
                    <li>Generally this is accomplished by having a member go offstage and secure the kill quickly</li>
                    <li>Another option: Stall the person with a repeatable edgeguard to build damage while your teammate protects you</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>The Importance of Grabbing Ledge</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grabbing the ledge is invaluable in an edgeguard</li>
                    <li>This removes not only their ability to stay safe, but some characters will use ledge invincibility to force you to give up a position you may want to keep</li>
                    <li>If you are ever in doubt regarding time or options, just hold ledge and reduce the chance of them finding a safe option</li>
                    <li>This is especially good for covering high recoveries as it prevents them from getting a drift back</li>
                    <li>Which character grabs ledge can be situational, but if given the choice you should have someone predetermined to grab ledge if there is an option</li>
                    <li>If there is not enough time, any character grabbing ledge is fine too</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Preventing Teammate Interference</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the process of preventing the teammate of someone being edgeguarded from salvaging the stock or creating a reversal</li>
                    <li>Obviously there's preventing the person onstage from physically reaching their teammate - this is generally a neutral situation in your favor since they are forced to approach</li>
                    <li>More complex is preventing help from projectiles</li>
                    <li>The awareness to block or eat projectiles is very important when securing an edgeguard</li>
                    <li><strong>Light shielding is one of the best ways to block projectiles</strong> - the shield is physically much bigger and can block more projectiles</li>
                    <li>If you are light shielding and predicting them to jump over to avoid the shield, you can stuff the jump with an aerial or put yourself in the path</li>
                    <li>Eating the projectile is usually very worth the trade - for example, eating a full set of needles in exchange for a stock is a very good trade</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Stalling Opponents</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is useful when there is a beneficial situation that you want your teammate to be able to keep</li>
                    <li>Being able to stall to keep them from helping is very effective and can generally turn into a great situation</li>
                    <li>Chaingrabbing, moves that send upwards, and grabs with pummels paired with a throw away from the situation can all be very good methods of keeping someone preoccupied</li>
                    <li>There are also characters that can stall someone offstage, such as Fox drilling from ledge over and over to keep them from coming back but preventing them from dying</li>

                <h3>Advanced Ledgeguarding Tactics - NMW</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ledge hogging timing:</strong> Practice grabbing ledge at the exact moment to deny recovery - too early and they can wait you out, too late and they grab it first</li>
                    <li><strong>Ledge trump setups:</strong> If your teammate is holding ledge, position yourself to cover all on-stage options with a single move</li>
                    <li><strong>Invincibility cycling:</strong> Use ledge invincibility to safely cover recovery options, then let your teammate take over</li>
                    <li><strong>Stage spike setups:</strong> Position near the wall to cover tech attempts after stage spikes</li>
                    <li><strong>Double ledge coverage:</strong> One player on ledge, one player covering high recovery - this covers all options</li>
                    <li><strong>Projectile edgeguarding:</strong> Use projectiles to force recovery timing while your teammate covers the ledge</li>
                    <li><strong>Ledge roll punishes:</strong> The on-stage player should always be ready to punish ledge rolls with a charged smash attack</li>

                <h3>Invincibility Management - NMW</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Respawn invincibility:</strong> When you respawn, you have significant invincibility - use it aggressively to create openings</li>
                    <li><strong>Double invincibility timing:</strong> If both players die close together, stagger your respawn drops so invincibility doesn't overlap</li>
                    <li><strong>Ledge invincibility:</strong> Use ledge invincibility to safely interrupt edgeguards on your teammate</li>
                    <li><strong>Invincible ledgedash:</strong> Fox's invincible ledgedash is one of the few times you should attack from ledge in doubles</li>
                    <li><strong>Respawn platform timing:</strong> Wait on the platform if your teammate is about to die - double invincibility is extremely powerful</li>
                    <li><strong>Aggressive invincibility usage:</strong> Don't waste invincibility by playing passively - use it to take stage control</li>
                    <li><strong>Invincibility baiting:</strong> Opponents must respect your invincibility - use this to force them into bad positions</li>
                    <li><strong>Covering teammate with invincibility:</strong> If your teammate is in a bad spot, use your respawn invincibility to save them</li>

                    <li>A good way to find out when you are safe to look somewhere else is to consider what would be "downtime" in Melee</li>
                    <li>The reason this varies by character is because some characters create downtime with hitstun in different ways</li>
                    <li>The more comfortable you are with your character and the more you understand what you need to focus on, the more you can understand when your focus can be directed elsewhere</li>

                    <li>A Falco can spend ten seconds pillaring and racking up damage in singles, but the longer a combo extends in teams, the more likely the opponent's teammate will hop in and interrupt</li>

                <h3>Character Viability in Teams</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When we re-examine each character's options in relation to time, we can see why certain characters are better or worse in teams compared to singles</li>
                    <li><strong>Worse in teams:</strong> Falco's solo combos take too long to rack up damage, Marth's standard edgeguards take too long, and Samus often takes too long to recover (allowing her teammate to get double teamed during her absence)</li>
                    <li><strong>Better in teams:</strong> Ganon's ability to deal a lot of damage quickly, while being less likely to be comboed for an extended period of time</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Why Team Combos Are Effective</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When we start thinking about time as a factor, it makes sense why team combos are so effective</li>
                    <li>Your teammate can stack damage on the opponent while you are still in your attack animation, and while your opponent is still in the hitstun of the attack</li>
                    <li>Once they volley the opponent back towards you, you are ready to do your next attack and send the opponent back towards your teammate</li>
                    <li>An entire teams death combo can happen within seconds, compared to the relatively longer amount of time for a singles death combo</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>Optimizing Combos for Teams</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>An understanding of how to optimize your combos for teams will help you improve drastically</li>
                    <li>Players who can do short, simple combos that put the opponent in a poor position are at an advantage</li>
                    <li>Poor positions include: being zoned out from helping their teammate, or being set up for team combos</li>
                    <li>This is better than players who opt for longer, more delicate strings that invite room for error or take too long to set up edgeguards</li>
                    <li>Marth and Falco supports who can send the opponent off the stage for an early kill are better teams players than ones who juggle their opponents for twenty hits</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Offensive Uses of Time</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Teammates that take longer to kill should hog the ledge while their teammate covers the high/stage option - this reduces the edgeguard cycle time</li>
                    <li>Fox's upsmash is less useful than his dsmash or fsmash if the opponent is not in kill percent for edgeguarding, but upsmash may buy enough time on floaties to set up team combos on the other opponent while they recover</li>
                    <li>Edgeguarding from the stage instead of going off stage usually leaves you vulnerable for a much shorter time, but sometimes going deep for an edgeguard and letting your teammate cover you makes it so that the edgeguard is much less interruptible by the opponent's teammate</li>
                    <li>Jigglypuff's rest is a much safer attack to throw out because your opponent will commonly not have enough (or any) time to set up a solid punish as long as your teammate is in a relatively neutral state</li>
                    <li>Doing team combos rather than singles combos when you get an opening increases damage output per the time you have allotted</li>
                    <li>Knocking a floaty away and then using the 4-5 seconds of their slow recovery to team combo their teammate instead</li>
                    <li>When spawning, choosing to fight the opponent currently engaging your teammate instead of the other opponent may maximize your damage output and grant you more stage control by the end of your spawn invincibility</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Defensive Uses of Time</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fox and Falco can repeatedly shine off stage to buy time for their teammate to come save them - it even works between stocks</li>
                    <li>Good teams players tend to recover high to buy time for their teammate to help</li>
                    <li>A player on stage can grab the opponent and hold them to prevent the opponent from edgeguarding</li>
                    <li>Blocking against Sheik is stronger because her throw game is slow damage accumulation and is likely to be interrupted</li>
                    <li>Ledgestalling or otherwise being evasive after your teammate gets killed or sent far away - your partner can 'rescue' you with their respawn invincibility</li>
                    <li>Recovering high gives your teammate time to break up edgeguards whereas recovering low makes it difficult for your teammate to help you out</li>
                    <li>Recovering high can give you multiple cycles of recovery which buys even more time</li>
                    <li>Walling out the other opponent when your teammate has a relatively guaranteed edgeguard, buying them time to complete it</li>
                    <li>As a floaty support, staying close to center stage makes it so you have the shortest time needed to help your teammate, and ensures you are not easy to ignore by the opposing team - this is why stage control is so important</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Try to understand what options you pick that Fox can truly punish you for</li>
                    <li>Stay diagonal above him (outside of fullhop bair range) or do moves in place to wall him</li>
                    <li>The best way to play against Fox is to understand the risk/reward from his perspective</li>
                    <li>Short range and a combo weight can make his decisions much more risky in most cases</li>
                    <li>Being aware of his threat zone can make him seem much more manageable</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Sheik's weaknesses come from taking advantage of her not being able to commit very well</li>
                    <li>There is a space right outside of her short hop fair, short hop bair, boost grab, or dash attack that gives her a very hard time</li>
                    <li>Sheik can have a hard time versus lower percent characters, though it can be somewhat negated in a lot of cases</li>
                    <li>She can also have a hard time coming down</li>
                    <li>Tend to wait for her to commit - she does very well off of her teammate's opening but can struggle to get her own, especially at lower percents</li>

                    <li>Falco is one of the easier characters to understand but can still be hard to deal with</li>
                    <li>Play platforms almost entirely against Falco - this gives him a hard time hitting you and gives you freedom to prevent him from being productive</li>
                    <li><strong>Two methods for handling lasers:</strong></li>
                    <li>Method 1: Stay in a range where he can't shoot lasers across the stage (like Peach/Marth matchup where you prevent turnip pulls) - relies heavily on two 1v1s</li>
                    <li>Method 2: Let him approach and then sandwich him - more positioning based and works well with platforms</li>
                    <li>Let the Falco take center and move around him, then carefully punish him while avoiding his long lasting moves</li>
                    <li>Try to physically block lasers a lot - they are usually very telegraphed</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Marth falls into a very specific category: an "ignore character"</li>
                    <li>Look for his threat range and whether or not he is forced to approach</li>
                    <li>His lack of projectile and somewhat hard time approaching can make it hard on Marth to control interactions</li>
                    <li>He has poor out of shield and can't cover both sides of him</li>
                    <li>However, Marth's strengths are extremely strong: hard punishes and a good wall</li>
                    <li>Try to force Marth to do something he is weakest at and then punish him in a way he can struggle with</li>

                    <li>Stay outside of Peach's threat ranges if you recognize that she will be in a space</li>
                    <li>She controls her approaching space very well so do not contest it</li>
                    <li>Float is one of the most powerful tools in doubles</li>
                    <li>Be aware of her slow movement and her options out of float</li>
                    <li>Focus on team punishes and positioning rather than traditional combos - you tend to get more off of them</li>
                    <li>If you throw her away, her movement is so slow she takes a long time to get back</li>
                    <li>If you team combo, she has a much harder time getting out compared to Fox upthrow upair</li>

                    <li>There are very few situations you would want to ignore Falcon, if any at all</li>
                    <li>He is a huge target with not great OoS options, needing space</li>
                    <li>Punishes usually take little time making it necessary to be in his range to interrupt those</li>

                    <li>Jigglypuff is similar to Marth in the way to play it: Ignore if controlling space, approach if they are forced to approach</li>
                    <li>Hold teammates hostage in these slower matchups and the Puff has to choose to be unproductive or force an approach they have a hard time winning</li>

                <h3>Fox in Doubles - Overview</h3>
                <p>Fox is the best character in doubles. He has the 2nd fastest ground speed, a strong jump squat, quick aerials, a versatile recovery and the ability to combo vertically and horizontally. He is the doubles character with the most freedom to play with the most amount of characters and playstyles.</p>
                <p>Fox is insanely good whether you decide to play aggressive or support. The strongest part of fox is that he can switch roles on the fly. He is a swiss army knife with many possible effective playstyles as well as possible team compositions he can play.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trades on key moves:</strong> Fox up smash, dash attacks, marth f smash, etc</li>
                    <li><strong>Punish laggy moves:</strong> When your teammate gets hit by a laggy move like a grab, dash attack or smash attack, punish the end lag to gain an opening</li>
                    <li><strong>Choose your punish wisely:</strong> You can punish with strong hitboxes (fox up smash, peach/sheik dash attack/down smash, falcon knee, falco dair, rest) but there's a chance you might get punished by their teammate. Fox nair and then getting out can be really strong</li>
                    <li><strong>Take calculated risks:</strong> If your move (fox up smash) can kill them and the stock count is even or better for you, take the RISK on getting reversaled if you know the kill is secured</li>
                    <li><strong>Suicide edgeguards:</strong> Can be really good in teams - often someone will be at low % and your stock is past 100% and it's worth the trade</li>

                    <li>Forcing yourself into an up close scramble to save your teammate in a bad spot - sometimes you just gotta watch them die and wait your turn instead of both getting killed by down smash blenders in corner</li>
                    <li>Throwing opposing team off stage towards the side your teammate is recovering can be a potential blunder</li>
                    <li>Hitting a light shield so they are able to grab ledge and edgeguard your teammate</li>

            <h2>Fox Move Breakdown - Zuppy</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Nair</h3>
                <p>This move can be used to pressure shields, hit jumps and hit people off stage. Fox nair knocks down Fox at 35% so around 30-40%ish on the cast overall it becomes a pretty strong move. It is an effective move to pass to your teammate since it doesn't send as far as back air but it lasts longer so you are more committed to the option.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Up Air</h3>
                <p>This move is best used to call out jumps and for kill confirms. It can be an effective combo starter below 30% as passing with fox back air before it knocks down doesn't let the move send far enough where your teammate can reliably pass back.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Back Air</h3>
                <p>One of the best moves in doubles - it can edgeguard, hold center, create team combos after it knocks down (in particular 31% on fox).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Drill</h3>
                <p>This move beats CC which is huge, and can help save your teammate as well. Drill waveshine, drill on shield (your teammate grabs shield), and drill grab are all great options.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Up Smash</h3>
                <p>Knocks down every character except Falcon at 0. Amazing kill option as well as combo route at low % with waveshine and up throw up smash. ASDI down tech in place is good counterplay to this option and it can be easily punished so make sure your up smashes count.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Shine</h3>
                <p>Shine spikes, waveshines, a frame 1 option that knocks down spacies, shield pressure, a consistent knockback for low % team combos - this move really does it all. Being cautious of shine setups is important. Lots of foxes try to waveshine oos when sometimes just doing an up smash oos is better because of the ability of your waveshine to get interrupted by their teammate.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Gameplans vs. Certain Characters - Zuppy</h2>
            
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2WVNM7m.png" alt="Fox" style="width: 24px; height: 24px; vertical-align: middle;"> Fox</h3>
                <p>Nair knocks down at 35%. Up throw up smash and shine tech chases are the best way to rack quick damage. Reaction tech chasing with up smash is stronger than grab due to extra damage and easier for your teammate to convert off. Full hop bair becomes strong at 31%. Drill is great for finding shines as it beats CC.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dbyctg5.png" alt="Falco" style="width: 24px; height: 24px; vertical-align: middle;"> Falco</h3>
                <p>Powershield and full hop are strong ways to deal with lasers. Double teaming falco can be an effective strategy because lasers make your life much more annoying. Having one person be a laser meat shield while you edgeguard is also strong. You can't really ignore falco because of his laser.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0TAZZIy.png" alt="Sheik" style="width: 24px; height: 24px; vertical-align: middle;"> Sheik</h3>
                <p>Her down throw isn't nearly as scary as it is in singles. Her grabs are only super punishing if her teammate is around. Up throw bair becomes pretty strong around 30% for easy team combos. Shield and cc are very strong because sheik cannot fight fox reliably unless her down smash or her teammate helps combo off sheiks grab.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fFLSjd8.png" alt="Peach" style="width: 24px; height: 24px; vertical-align: middle;"> Peach</h3>
                <p>Probably the hardest matchup to adjust to in doubles compared to singles. You are unable to laser camp peach and it is very hard to hit her below 30% safely. Grab on peach in doubles is so much better because your teammate can help team combo off your back throw. She is extremely strong at low % and might even be the best character in the format at 0%. Light shield is very strong vs down smash.</p>

                <p>Lasers aren't as strong as they are in singles. Make sure you and your teammate discuss how they will interrupt up throw rest to save you if you miss the DI. When she is off stage it's best to 2v1 their partner as edgeguarding her can be risky and takes a lot of time.</p>

            <h2>Throws vs Holding - Zuppy</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <p>Throws do extra damage and some can be quite easy to follow up off with your own bair/up smash/up air/up tilt after getting passed to. Until grab release, up smash will do half damage. 18% damage becomes 9% in the grab. This impacts damage output and kills.</p>
                <p>Anytime your up smash normally kills in singles just add 9% when it's off the grab. You can kill even earlier if you wait for grab release or charge your up smash too. Some characters pass best off their own throw into their own moves like fox with up throw into bair on floaty characters and up throw up smash on fast fallers.</p>

                <h3>General Tips as Fox</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Throw into Fox up smash will do more damage than grab holds (grab holds reduce % up smash does)</li>
                    <li>Going high helps you recover especially if your teammate has a projectile</li>
                    <li>Drill is a great tool to prevent your teammate from dying after they get hit by a super strong move</li>
                    <li>Up smash is amazing at trading with opponents hitting your teammate</li>
                    <li>Deep edgeguards can be scary since you'll have to up b afterwards - always look at the stocks count and %s to make better decisions</li>

            <div class="source-section">
                <p>Fox is strong on every stage in doubles. It's best to counter pick based off your teammates strengths and the other characters weaknesses.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Yoshi's:</strong> Really strong CP if you aren't teaming with a floaty who dies early and you aren't fighting sheik peach or double peach with crazy down smash stage hazards</li>
                    <li><strong>Stadium:</strong> Generally will be the strongest counterpick you have. Lots of room and early kills is very nice for you</li>
                    <li><strong>Battlefield:</strong> Scary vs things like recovery vs falco down air but for the most part a pretty neutral stage and can pair well with any comp</li>
                    <li><strong>Dreamland:</strong> Great if you are teaming with a floaty you want to stock tank, not as good if you are trying to kill. The space can be really good for you. Dreamland will benefit the stronger singles players as it's easier to separate teammates</li>
                    <li><strong>FD:</strong> Chain grabs aren't as threatening as they are in singles but getting comboed feels terrible on this stage. Edgeguarding and punish are a lot more simple which can work out to your benefit or demise. Sharking landings with grab and letting fox up smash is an amazing way to kill floaties</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Ultimately you will have to discuss with your teammate what stages you like and dislike. Consider how much space your team needs and how important platforms are.</p>

                <h3>Time is Your Most Important Resource</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In doubles, when you land a hit, you earn position, an opportunity to follow up, and time to eye the whole screen</li>
                    <li>Look at everyone on the screen every time you don't have a guaranteed follow up</li>
                    <li>Grabs, tech chases, or vertical launchers should allow you to look at the whole screen</li>
                    <li>Many times, after landing a hit, you should immediately run across the stage and 2v1 or help your teammate recover</li>
                    <li>It's much better to get a guaranteed kill than to try to continue a tech chase or combo with a reset</li>
                    <li>Helping recoveries should generally be prioritized over getting kills</li>
                    <li>Try to always be looking at your teammate - this will give you way more time to get in position for a pass</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Feel the Urgency</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using time efficiently means you often have to drop what you are doing in favor of another opportunity</li>
                    <li>Don't play neutral unnecessarily</li>
                    <li>Once one person is offstage, everyone should collapse on that ledge</li>
                    <li>If you are waiting for someone to land after you launched them vertically, you are messing up - don't wait</li>
                    <li>Unless you've hit two floaties high in the air or far off stage, there is always something useful you can do</li>
                    <li>Baiting is much worse in doubles; brute force is favored</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>You should almost always pass to your teammate unless your next punish move will KILL (either off the top or the side)</li>
                    <li>Fox should almost always up throw → bair to pass to their teammate because his forward/back throws are not good</li>

                <h3>Combo at Full Hop Height</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You want to combo in such a way where the opponent is high enough % to be hit/passed horizontally with just a full hop attack</li>
                    <li>It's much easier to pass back and forth with alternating full hop attacks</li>
                    <li>Short hop height combos give way less time to position and less time to react</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Determine Whose "Turn" It Is</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This can be determined by the proximity of the enemy relative to you and your teammate</li>
                    <li>If a teammate launches an enemy directly above them and they're able to continue, they should go for the follow-up</li>
                    <li>If the opponent DIs away and ends up closer to the other teammate, let them continue the combo as it is now in their space</li>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Back Up When Your Opponent is About to Pass</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you are next to your teammate and an opponent gets popped up and they are about to hit the enemy towards you, run AWAY from your teammate in the same direction the enemy is being passed to</li>
                    <li>This makes it much easier to follow-up as the travel time gives you more time to react</li>
                    <li>Think about a football player going for a long pass - they start running before the ball is even thrown</li>
                    <li>The higher % someone is, the higher/faster/farther they will fly, so you need to compensate by running back even farther</li>

            </div>
            <div class="source-section">

                <ul>
                    <li>When you or your teammate land a launching move, don't both follow-up at the same time</li>
                    <li>If that happens, your combo ends immediately as you are both stuck in lag from hitting the same person</li>
                    <li>There are a lot of frames of hit stun that can be used before passing back to allow your teammate to recover from their move's animation lag</li>
                    <li>Pass back and forth rhythmically until the next hit kills</li>

                <h3>Move Selection for Team Combos</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use numerous mid to weak knockback moves, sending the opponent to your partner - play ping pong with them</li>
                    <li>Try not to hit them too far past your partner - keep them between the two of you</li>
                    <li>On FD, use more horizontal moves because there is nowhere to escape to</li>
                    <li>On other stages, you may want to carry the opponent up the platforms to continue your combo</li>
                    <li>Moves with lateral knockback are generally better for teams combos, whereas vertical knockback is often preferred in singles</li>
                    <li>Look for combos that send to top platform and finish with up smash</li>
                    <li>Up tilt is very important, especially off of throws - great combo starter</li>
                    <li>If there is time, charge the up smash off of your teammate's grab - hits do less damage/knockback out of grab, so charge is very useful</li>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>DO NOT PRIORITIZE EDGE GUARDS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>GO FOR THE 2v1 after hitting someone off stage, especially FLOATIES that are NOT EDGE GUARDABLE</li>
                    <li>Puff, Peach, Samus recoveries take a very long time, but these characters are almost always going to make it back regardless</li>
                    <li>Instead, you can go for a 2v1 or help your teammate which can net you WAY MORE</li>
                    <li>These characters are NOT worth edge guarding EVER in teams unless it's a final last stock 2v1</li>
                    <li>Even trying to edge guard spacies when they have several recovery option mixups, you are better off going for a 2v1 attempt</li>
                    <li>A 2v1 from an experienced team is way more valuable than an edge guard attempt</li>
                    <li>Having an opponent at high % isn't bad because they are going to get put into a situation where they have to recover more, giving more opportunities for 2v1 scenarios</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Why Edgeguarding is Generally Worse in Teams</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the enemy team is experienced, they can make it quite difficult for someone to edge guard them</li>
                    <li>They can stall their recoveries and wait for their teammate to come save them</li>
                    <li>Falco lasers and sheik needles can help interrupt edge guards or save their teammates</li>
                    <li>Think about how long it takes for marth to dthrow dtilt a fox and then go off with fair or reverse up B - now think about how much LESS time it takes for an enemy fox to run over and shine</li>
                    <li>If someone goes for an extended edge guard, it is very likely it will be interrupted</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>When Edge Guards CAN Be Worth It</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The enemy has very limited recovery options that can be guaranteed/easily covered by you alone (they can only go to ledge)</li>
                    <li>The enemy teammate that is on stage is occupied (getting comboed by your teammate, also recovering, dead, etc)</li>
                    <li>Your teammate is in a position where they can/will wall off the enemy from trying to interrupt the edge guard</li>
                    <li>If it is a 2v1 scenario where there are only three players on the screen, you should always edge guard with your teammate</li>
                    <li>If your teammate has an easy edgeguard, let them go for it - be a body to protect them while their teammate comes to attempt to save. Literally standing there and light shielding can be a good strategy vs falco lasers</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Team Ledge Guard Coordination</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>One player should always cover the ledge and the other should always cover on stage recoveries</li>
                    <li>Whoever is closer to the ledge should grab it, and the other person covers on stage recovery</li>
                    <li>If you have the freedom to choose who grabs the ledge, whoever has a more guaranteed killing move should cover the on stage option</li>
                    <li>2v1 ledge guards are largely guaranteed - it's almost always better to take the guaranteed kill rather than being greedy and trying to get two</li>
                    <li>Someone should always grab edge and roll</li>

                <h3>Defense to Offense Spectrum</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't switch from defense to offense - there's a spectrum of defense, neutral, and offense</li>
                    <li>If you are on defense, you are in an intrinsically bad position to start offense</li>
                    <li>When you are shielding, on knockdown, or on the ledge, you have infinitely fewer options than someone with freedom of movement</li>
                    <li>If your front line is forced to play defense, this is time for him to rotate out and let the back line start offense</li>
                    <li>After recovering from defense to neutral, you can choose to immediately rotate back in</li>
                    <li>Notable exceptions include Fox's invincible ledgedash and shine OOS when your teammate's options are too slow</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Basic Rhythm</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most compositions have a fairly strong preference for which character should be in front and which should be in back</li>
                    <li>When your front line goes in, the backup follows and improves positioning by being close behind</li>
                    <li>If the front player loses the neutral, the back line goes in and tries to hold as much space as possible</li>
                    <li>One exchange is generally enough time for your front line to have regained his footing</li>
                    <li>The job of the support is basically to buy time until the carry is back on his feet</li>
                    <li>Switching between front line and backline should be a choreographed dance</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Optimal Positioning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In neutral, players will be arranged X X Y Y (teams stay together)</li>
                    <li>X Y X Y situation can create decimating team combos on a sandwiched player, but requires confidence and precision</li>
                    <li>X YY X situation means X players are separated and YY controls center stage - ideal for teams with a zoning character</li>
                    <li>XYYX creates a team sandwich where the Y team has no space and can be pressured on both sides</li>
                    <li>Stay about a Falcon dashdance or Marth tipper fsmash range away from your teammate</li>
                    <li>Don't break formation for no reason - maintaining position is of utmost importance</li>
                    <li>One person attacking at a time is generally preferable</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Cover Options Together</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't overlap with your teammate - this is most relevant in ledge play</li>
                    <li>Start extremely simple to make coordination easy, then expand with more complex options</li>
                    <li>At high levels of play, most of the time someone hits their teammate, it is the fault of the person who got hit for not correctly covering options together</li>
                    <li>Crossing streams/jumping over your teammate, going off stage for ledge guards, and trying to follow up after your teammate lands a launcher are common things that mess up coordination</li>
                    <li>Cover any tech roll towards you, and ignore the rest</li>
                    <li>On platforms, cover all the options with your teammate every time - whoever is closer to center covers the inward option, whoever can get to the outside faster covers that one</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Center Stage Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you lose stage positioning and are cornered/off stage in a 1v2, you are almost certainly doomed</li>
                    <li>Worse yet, you obligate your partner to try to get you out of the bad situation</li>
                    <li>This potentially leads to both of you cornered or off stage, and regaining your footing is like climbing a mountain</li>
                    <li>When you have an opponent sandwiched, space attacks on both sides of them</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>If you are playing a support role, you should spend 90% of your time watching your teammate</li>
                    <li>When you are in formation, this will let you react to any development</li>

                    <li>When you are against a fast faller, a Marth, or anyone teaming with a floatie, you will have a preference to kill these characters</li>
                    <li>If you are focused on killing one person, you are on the hunt</li>
                    <li>You don't want your opponent to sniff out that you are on the hunt - if they know you've mentally committed, they can make the cost too high</li>
                    <li>You should almost never hunt floaties - if they are just trying to stay safe, they are not contributing meaningfully</li>
                    <li>It is much easier to keep them away and punish them when they try to come in than to attack them on defense</li>
                    <li>If they are out of the fray, they are useless, so there is no need to kill them</li>
                    <li>People open themselves up to being hit when they approach, so just punish the floatie once he tries to get into the fray</li>
                    <li>Mask your hunt by moving deceptively and by switching targets whenever opportune</li>
                    <li>If someone is at 200% and 4 stocks while their teammate is at 0% and 2 stocks, it's still almost always better to double team the person at 0</li>
                    <li>Double team the fastfaller - Falco, Fox, then Falcon should be the preference</li>

                    <li>Fighting opponents at 0 is really hard by yourself due to the universal answer to CC is grab, and grabs are slow in teams</li>

                    <li>When your teammate is dead and you are waiting for a respawn, it's best to light shield, camp plats or ledge stall until you can play again safely</li>

                    <li><strong>Shield blocking:</strong> Position your shield between your teammate and the opponent to absorb hits</li>
                    <li><strong>Grab interrupts:</strong> Grabbing an opponent mid-combo on your teammate immediately stops the combo</li>
                    <li><strong>Platform interference:</strong> Drop through platforms with aerials to interrupt combos happening below</li>
                    <li><strong>Shine saves:</strong> Fox/Falco shine can interrupt almost any combo on your teammate</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing awareness:</strong> Know when your teammate is in true hitstun vs when they can act - save them during true combos</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Losing center stage in doubles is one of the worst positions to be in</li>
                    <li>When cornered or off stage in a 1v2, you are almost certainly doomed</li>
                    <li>Worse yet, you obligate your partner to try to get you out of the bad situation</li>
                    <li>This can lead to both of you cornered or off stage, and regaining footing is like climbing a mountain</li>
                    <li>Prevention is always better than recovery when it comes to stage position</li>

                <h3>Strategies for Regaining Center Stage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Platform movement:</strong> Use platforms to circumvent zoning and reposition toward center</li>
                    <li><strong>Coordinated push:</strong> Both players move toward center simultaneously to force opponents to give ground</li>
                    <li><strong>Projectile cover:</strong> Use projectiles to create space for your teammate to move forward</li>
                    <li><strong>Respawn advantage:</strong> Use respawn invincibility aggressively to reclaim center stage</li>
                    <li><strong>Trade positioning:</strong> Sometimes taking a hit while moving forward is worth it to regain stage position</li>
                    <li><strong>Ledge pressure:</strong> If stuck at ledge, use ledge options to create space rather than trying to fight from ledge</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't fight from corner:</strong> If cornered, focus on escaping rather than trying to win neutral from a bad position</li>

                    <li>Use platforms proactively to maintain center stage presence</li>
                    <li>Don't chase opponents to the corner if it means giving up center stage</li>

                <h3>What is the Invisible Ceiling Glitch</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The invisible ceiling glitch occurs when a character is hit upward while very close to a platform</li>
                    <li>The character will bonk on the platform as if there's a ceiling, even though they're below it</li>
                    <li>This causes them to enter tumble animation and fall back down much faster than normal</li>
                    <li>This can completely change combo trajectories and create unexpected follow-up opportunities</li>
                    <li>It's especially relevant in doubles where characters are frequently near platforms during team combos</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Using the Invisible Ceiling to Your Advantage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When team comboing near platforms, be aware that upward hits may cause the ceiling glitch</li>
                    <li>This can extend combos by bringing the opponent back down faster than expected</li>
                    <li>Position yourself to follow up on the faster fall from the ceiling bonk</li>
                    <li>On stages like Battlefield and Yoshi's Story, this happens frequently due to platform layout</li>
                    <li>The glitch can turn what would be a combo escape into a continued punish</li>
                    <li>Be ready to react when you see the bonk animation - you have a brief window for follow-ups</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Avoiding the Invisible Ceiling as the Victim</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>DI away from platforms when being hit upward to avoid the ceiling glitch</li>
                    <li>Be aware of your position relative to platforms during combos</li>
                    <li>If you bonk, SDI and DI to escape the follow-up</li>
                    <li>The ceiling glitch is most dangerous on stages with low platforms like Yoshi's Story</li>

                    <li><strong>Falco laser timing:</strong> Falco lasers do less stun than end lag of some laggy moves - be careful of stopping smash attacks ESPECIALLY PEACH AND SHEIK DOWN SMASH</li>
                    <li><strong>Forcing scrambles:</strong> Forcing yourself into an up close scramble to save your teammate in a bad spot - sometimes you just gotta watch them die and wait your turn</li>
                    <li><strong>Throwing towards recovery:</strong> Throwing opposing team off stage towards the side your teammate is recovering can be a potential blunder - this also applies to hitting a light shield so they are able to grab ledge and edgeguard your teammate</li>
                    <li><strong>Pushing someone onto the edge while your partner is recovering:</strong> Someone is ledge guarding your teammate, you try to pressure them, they shield and your attack hits them onto the edge, messing up your partner's recovery.

                <h3>General Projectile Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are facing away from your teammate, your projectiles can't hit them</li>
                    <li>Your teammate can duck under, jump over, spotdodge etc your projectiles to help assist approaches</li>
                    <li>Laser above teammate is 8-10 frames - fox can't jump, you can use shine/grab approaches for the laser to help assist</li>
                    <li>Recovering high is very good to help sheik needle and laser assists</li>
                    <li>Full stack needles WILL hit your teammate somehow if they are in front of you, no matter how many bodies are between you two</li>
                    <li>Generally if you can punish with an aerial, smash attack, grab, or dash attack, it's better than shooting a projectile in terms of trading</li>
                    <li>Projectiles are best in front of your teammate in A(A)BB positioning or in B(A)AB positioning shooting to the left to protect your control</li>
                    <li>Don't spam projectiles stupidly - don't use projectiles because you can, do them because they are going to be good</li>

                    <li>Light shield blocks short hop lasers and shine can reflect them - it's very good when Falco wants to prevent edgeguards by assisting the recovery/hitting the edgeguarder to interrupt them</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>To be good at 1v2, you need to be as threatening as you can while as noncommittal as possible</li>
                    <li>Don't over commit on the person at high percent and don't over commit on ledge guards that expose you once you finish them</li>
                    <li>Move a lot - moves have lag, movement doesn't</li>
                    <li>Try as hard as you can to be slippery and to make it unclear which opponent you will attack</li>
                    <li>Being predictable will get you locked down - once you aren't moving, you are probably dead</li>
                    <li>Crossups are especially good in 1v2, though be wary of potentially putting yourself in sandwich situations</li>
                    <li>Avoid shielding and for the love of god, don't grab</li>
                    <li>If you feel threatened, move or shield. Maybe attack. Never spot dodge</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The system is skewed dramatically from singles</li>
                    <li>Characters like Marth, Falco, or Sheik cannot do their protracted followups in teams like they can in singles</li>
                    <li>In singles, laggy finishing moves are high risk, high reward. In teams, they are low risk, high reward</li>
                    <li>Throw out your finishing moves much more liberally</li>
                    <li>Even if you do get hit off stage, most easily ledge guardable characters in singles can make it back to the stage with a good partner</li>
                    <li>It's almost always best to just go for your hardest punish as fast as possible rather than extended combos/tech chases/chain grabs</li>

            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Double Fox</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain a certain distance from each other and help when needed</li>
                    <li>Possibly okay to basically play singles until a big launcher happens and then look for team combos</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Fox/Falco</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Probably the only team where Falco can really thrive</li>
                    <li>Let the Fox do the approaching, and should the Fox hit someone toward the Falco, the Falco can probably get a big combo started</li>
                    <li>Falco makes it a giant pain to ledge guard Fox</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Fox/Falcon</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This team is fast and packs a punch</li>
                    <li>Between shine, Fox's usmash, and knee, you have most of the best killing moves in the game on the fastest characters</li>
                    <li>Use your mobility to your advantage - take to the top platform when feeling scared</li>
                    <li>Grab combos are brutal, ledge guards should generally end in one hit</li>
                    <li>You can go to Yoshi's to smother opponents or Dreamland to abuse mobility</li>
                    <li>Against double spacies, the Falcon should not approach much - take advantage of his knee and speed, not his neutral game</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Fox/Peach</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fox is the best carry and Peach is an amazing support</li>
                    <li>Zone, ledge guard, and save your teammate with Peach</li>
                    <li>Peach's dsmash is great for creating chaos when people get an opening on the Fox</li>
                    <li>Sheik can down smash puff's shield, which locks her down so we can pressure her</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Fox/Puff</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Similar to Fox/Peach, but with more kill power</li>
                    <li>Puff can go deeper off stage because of multiple jumps</li>
                    <li>Grab+rest is ridiculously good, and Fox's speed and shinegrab make him great at getting grabs</li>
                    <li>Rest is amazing for punishing rolls - tech rolling into the stage means rolling into a rest</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="source-section">
                <h3>Double Floaties</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Turns the teams meta upside down - their stocks are inherently harder to take</li>
                    <li>If playing against them, you need to play super cautious and just win the neutral game almost every time</li>
                    <li>If you are the double floaties team, your goal is to stay alive long enough to get a brutal opening on your opponents</li>
                    <li>Watch HBox and Plup for the best double floaty play</li>

            <h2>Stage Selection - NMW</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Final Destination:</strong> The Battlefield of doubles - by far the most common starter. Favors good teamwork because team combos cannot be escaped via platforms, team ledge guards are simplified, and reestablishing team formation can be near impossible because there is no way to circumvent zoning characters</li>
                    <li><strong>Dreamland:</strong> Has a lot of ground space, high top platform, plenty of room to move around on platforms, and huge blast zones. The boons for mobile characters often outweigh the survivability buff for floaties. Having an incredible amount of space to maneuver makes it easier for fast characters to pick their spots and reset to neutral with ease. Can still be good for floaties because of blast zones. Wispy complicates team ledge guards</li>
                    <li><strong>Yoshi's Story:</strong> Fighting in close quarters favors teams with better teamwork. Team coverage on platform tech chases are ridiculously easy because of small platforms at low heights. Randall and wall jumps significantly alter recovery possibilities. Small blast zones buff characters with strong kill power. Hitboxes cover way more of this stage than any other. It is easier to close distance here, so if you are getting camped and want to force them to fight, consider Yoshi's. Double Peach and Peach Sheik are teams you want to ban this stage against</li>
                    <li><strong>Pokemon Stadium:</strong> Does not loan itself to strategic advantages as much as other stages. Stadium gives transformations which favor Fox and big swings. Walls destroy the correlation between losing a stock and having high percent</li>
                    <li><strong>Battlefield:</strong> Has a high top platform, allowing characters with good vertical mobility to choose their spots carefully. Nerfs Fox recovery. The only middle sized stage</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid - NMW</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trying too hard to follow up:</strong> Sometimes at the cost of highly advantageous positioning. Back off, regroup, maintain cohesion</li>
                    <li><strong>Not collapsing on your partner quickly enough:</strong> If your partner earns stage positioning, you must move with them quickly</li>
                    <li><strong>Crowding your teammate:</strong> Stay out of the range of any hitboxes they are likely to use if they are in front</li>
                    <li><strong>Going for grabs in inappropriate situations:</strong> Dashdance grab is the worst strategy in teams. Don't go for grabs in 1v2 or in 2v2 when neither team is separated</li>
                    <li><strong>Exposing yourself to 1v2 situations:</strong> Don't cross up the other team's front line often unless you're an amazing Fox player or S2J</li>
                    <li><strong>Not capitalizing on 2v1s:</strong> Don't run away and try to hit the floaty at 150%. Annihilate fast fallers as fast as you can</li>
                    <li><strong>Rolling into the other team:</strong> Both out of shield and on knockdowns - this is an easy way to get yourself killed</li>
                    <li><strong>Not taking your partner's stock:</strong> 2v1 is basically hopeless if your opponents have decent teamwork</li>
                    <li><strong>Ledgehop aerials:</strong> Generally it's better to let your partner try to create space for you than to do something risky from the ledge</li>
                    <li><strong>Recovering to the ledge:</strong> Good players hold onto the ledge in teams - don't expect them to try to get off</li>
                    <li><strong>Letting go of the ledge:</strong> You should hold onto the ledge - taking away recovery to the ledge makes it dramatically easier for your partner to cover remaining options</li>
                    <li><strong>Not helping a recovering partner:</strong> Develop your map awareness and watch everyone on the screen</li>
                    <li><strong>Trying to recover when it's hopeless:</strong> If your partner is getting comboed on the stage, kill yourself as fast as possible to get back in the fray sooner</li>
                    <li><strong>Reading tech rolls into your partner's zone:</strong> This is their zone. Let them cover it</li>
                    <li><strong>Going for the right option too late:</strong> Don't try to make up for not seeing something quickly enough by doing something that's too optimistic once you react</li>

            <h2>Fundamental Easy Strategies - NMW</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>When pressuring, try to alternate hitboxes on their shield, react to a roll, or grab them</li>
                    <li>Read missed techs - it's harder to keep track of everything in doubles, so guessing a missed tech often leads to a kill</li>
                    <li>Read tech rolls toward their teammate - in teams, tech rolling toward one's partner is a highly prominent defensive habit</li>
                    <li>If you pay attention to singles interactions, it should be even easier to pick up on habits</li>
                    <li>Test your opponents for weaknesses before trying to hit them</li>
                    <li>The more opportunities you give an opponent to do something dumb, the higher likelihood that they will do something dumb</li>

            <h2>Mindset and Philosophy - NMW</h2>
            <div class="source-section">
                <ul>
                    <li>The only way to beat someone with strong neutral and dirty punish is to also have strong neutral and dirty punish</li>
                    <li>You don't have to win this position. You can win the next position</li>
                    <li>To punish well, sometimes we must hit → move → react</li>
                    <li>It is better to believe that they are too far away and get hit than making commitments from too far away</li>
                    <li>Protect yourself, know how to kill, then outplay</li>
                    <li>If you aren't sure what's happening, disengage (especially vs Falco)</li>
                    <li>"My opponent isn't going to let me kill them. What are they going to do to avoid being killed?"</li>
                    <li>It is important to have your decisions agree with your position. You can't dash back and be aggressive; it doesn't work</li>
                    <li>Try your best, and have fun doing so. Look at the opponent, make active decisions, and enjoy the journey!</li>
