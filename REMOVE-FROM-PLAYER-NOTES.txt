INSTRUCTIONS: Remove these 3 entries from player-notes.json

Remove the following entries (they've been moved to concepts.html):

1. "playerName": "How to beat floaty mid tiers conceptually -- Billy Notes"
2. "playerName": "Marth Advice and Concepts from Billy"  
3. "playerName": "Advice from Zamu (not player notes)"

These are now organized in the new Concepts & Lessons page (concepts.html).

After removing them from player-notes.json, export the updated JSON from the player notes page and replace the file, then push to GitHub.
