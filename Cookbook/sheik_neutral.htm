* Drill shine → uptilt (14% knockdown, chain uptilts or techchase)
* Drill uptilt → uptilt

 The 1 and 3 mixup pattern

This is a basic mixup pattern that Fiction proposes for playing Fox against Sheik in neutral. You do not want to fight Sheik when you can’t do this.

The 1 and 3 come from counting/numbering how many times we dash dance before we attack. So a “1” is just running in and attacking. A “2” would be dashing away, then dashing in and attacking. A “3” would be dashing in, then dashing away, then dashing in and attacking. And so on. 3 is the most powerful against Sheik - almost everything you do should be a variation on the 3. 

When you do attack and dash in on Sheik, you have 4 options:
* Running shine
* Running nair
* Running grab
* Fullhop over -&gt; aerial
	
There is nothing that Sheik can do to cover all 4 of these options. When you threaten her with one of these 4, she’s gonna get antsy, and she’ll probably do an ftilt or wavedash back - she has to do something to deal with it, but she can’t deal with all of them. 

The big mistake many players make is that they want to dash in, dash out, and then react to what Sheik does. This is the wrong mentality. Always force the Sheik to react to your option. If you play against Sheik and say “I’m gonna bait them” and dash back and watch the Sheik, by the time you see the ftilt it’s too late to punish it - she is borderline impossible to punish on reaction. Sheik’s walling with ftilts and fairs is actually very vulnerable, but you can’t punish it on reaction. But Sheik has to do something to deal with this big mixup Fox has, and if she doesn’t she’s gonna get run over.

The 3 generally looks like a medium-length dash in (give Sheik something to react to) followed by a short dash back, then a dash in and instant attack. You don’t want to try to react. If Sheik throws out a move, the dash back will give you just enough timing mixup to beat her. Once they catch on a little and start to wait, the 1 starts to work really well. 
	
Because Sheik can’t cover everything, Fox ends up with a favorable mixup - anything Fox does Sheik can technically punish him for, but Fox has like 10 things that kill Sheik if they work, and she can only kill Fox is she guesses correctly which of those 10 things Fox is going to do.

When Fiction plays a Sheik he just asks “Will I do a 1 or a 3? I’ll do a 1. What’ll I do after the 1? Running shine.” He doesn’t actually pay attention to the Sheik player. The more you pay attention the more you’ll try to react to what Sheik is doing, and the more you’ll lose. She’s the only character where it’s worse if you try to play neutral against her. You can’t say as Fox, “I’m gonna wait for you to make a mistake,” because that’s what Sheik wants. But Fox wants her to constantly feel like Fox is rolling the dice and throwing out a move - which you should, because that’s the hardest thing for her to deal with.
	
Fiction calls dash in fullhop attack a “sneaky” 3 - you move in with the dash in, then you move out of Sheik’s threat range temporarily with the fullhop over her, then you try to hit her. It’s the same concept of Fox threatening and Sheik having to respond, then immediately punishing her after her response.

<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold antialiased text-slate-100 my-2" level="3" node="[object Object]">The 1 and 3 mixup pattern</h3>
<div class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-relaxed my-2 max-w-7xl" node="[object Object]">This
 is a basic mixup pattern that Fiction proposes for playing Fox against 
Sheik in neutral. You do not want to fight Sheik when you can’t do this.</div>
<div class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-relaxed my-2 max-w-7xl" node="[object Object]">The
 1 and 3 come from counting/numbering how many times we dash dance 
before we attack. So a “1” is just running in and attacking. A “2” would
 be dashing away, then dashing in and attacking. A “3” would be dashing 
in, then dashing away, then dashing in and attacking. And so on. 3 is 
the most powerful against Sheik - almost everything you do should be a 
variation on the 3.</div>
<div class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-relaxed my-2 max-w-7xl" node="[object Object]">When you do attack and dash in on Sheik, you have 4 options:</div>
<ul class="pl-8 list-disc text-slate-300" depth="0" node="[object Object]">
<li class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-loose" index="0" node="[object Object]">Running shine</li>
<li class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-loose" index="1" node="[object Object]">Running nair</li>
<li class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-loose" index="2" node="[object Object]">Running grab</li>
<li class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-loose" index="3" node="[object Object]">Fullhop over -&gt; aerial</li>
</ul>
<div class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-relaxed my-2 max-w-7xl" node="[object Object]">There
 is nothing that Sheik can do to cover all 4 of these options. When you 
threaten her with one of these 4, she’s gonna get antsy, and she’ll 
probably do an ftilt or wavedash back - she has to do something to deal 
with it, but she can’t deal with all of them.</div>
<div class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-relaxed my-2 max-w-7xl" node="[object Object]">The
 big mistake many players make is that they want to dash in, dash out, 
and then react to what Sheik does. This is the wrong mentality. Always 
force the Sheik to react to your option. If you play against Sheik and 
say “I’m gonna bait them” and dash back and watch the Sheik, by the time
 you see the ftilt it’s too late to punish it - she is borderline 
impossible to punish on reaction. Sheik’s walling with ftilts and fairs 
is actually very vulnerable, but you can’t punish it on reaction. But 
Sheik has to do something to deal with this big mixup Fox has, and if 
she doesn’t she’s gonna get run over.</div>
<div class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-relaxed my-2 max-w-7xl" node="[object Object]">The
 3 generally looks like a medium-length dash in (give Sheik something to
 react to) followed by a short dash back, then a dash in and instant 
attack. You don’t want to try to react. If Sheik throws out a move, the 
dash back will give you just enough timing mixup to beat her. Once they 
catch on a little and start to wait, the 1 starts to work really well.</div>
<div class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-relaxed my-2 max-w-7xl" node="[object Object]">Because
 Sheik can’t cover everything, Fox ends up with a favorable mixup - 
anything Fox does Sheik can technically punish him for, but Fox has like
 10 things that kill Sheik if they work, and she can only kill Fox is 
she guesses correctly which of those 10 things Fox is going to do.</div>
<div class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-relaxed my-2 max-w-7xl" node="[object Object]">When
 Fiction plays a Sheik he just asks “Will I do a 1 or a 3? I’ll do a 1. 
What’ll I do after the 1? Running shine.” He doesn’t actually pay 
attention to the Sheik player. The more you pay attention the more 
you’ll try to react to what Sheik is doing, and the more you’ll lose. 
She’s the only character where it’s worse if you try to play neutral 
against her. You can’t say as Fox, “I’m gonna wait for you to make a 
mistake,” because that’s what Sheik wants. But Fox wants her to 
constantly feel like Fox is rolling the dice and throwing out a move - 
which you should, because that’s the hardest thing for her to deal with.</div>
<div class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-relaxed my-2 max-w-7xl" node="[object Object]">Fiction
 calls dash in fullhop attack a “sneaky” 3 - you move in with the dash 
in, then you move out of Sheik’s threat range temporarily with the 
fullhop over her, then you try to hit her. It’s the same concept of Fox 
threatening and Sheik having to respond, then immediately punishing her 
after her response.</div>
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold antialiased text-slate-100 my-2" level="3" node="[object Object]">Clown Nairs, Not Dairs</h3>
<div class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-relaxed my-2 max-w-7xl" node="[object Object]">“Clown
 nairs” are basically just Fox nairs that are kind of just mindless 
rushdown nairs. It’s hard for Sheik to deal with Fox just jumping in 
with a nair, and Fox gets to clip her a lot of the time.</div>
<div class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-relaxed my-2 max-w-7xl" node="[object Object]">On
 the flipside, Fox’s short hop dair in neutral is not as good against 
Sheik, because she’s kind of skinny, and will frequently pop out of the 
dair and grab Fox even without really good SDI. Drill tends to be better
 as a whiff punish, because the dair in neutral leads to Fox getting 
grabbed a lot of the time. Dair in neutral will mostly be limited to the
 fullhop portion of the mixup, where Fox can react to Sheik’s response 
and whiff punish her with the drill.</div>
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold antialiased text-slate-100 my-2" level="3" node="[object Object]">Updown Lasers</h3>
<div class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-relaxed my-2 max-w-7xl" node="[object Object]">If
 Fox wants to start a match with lasers, he should do what Fiction calls
 updown lasers. This just means drop through the platform with a laser, 
then fullhop double laser back onto the platform, and repeat. This can 
be infuriating for Fox’s opponent, and is a good tool for Fox when he’s 
not feeling very aggro. He doesn’t want to react to Sheik, but can just 
avoid her entirely using platforms. Typically Fox wants to use these 
lasers to get Sheik to reach a point where 1 is unreactable, and at that
 point you have your 1 and 3 mixup pattern.</div>
<div class="text-slate-300 tracking-wide leading-relaxed my-2 max-w-7xl" node="[object Object]">The
 only thing Sheik can do about this is standing needles, which requires a
 hard read. If Sheik commits to trying to needle Fox on the platform, 
Fox can just choose to run under her platform and upair her instead of

If she guesses right, she gets a free low percent rest. If she guesses wrong it doesn’t matter as its very easy to react if you guessed wrong or not. There is a way to get rid of this 50-50 entirely, making it a very similar gimmick to Ice Climbers’ down-throw \u003e down-air.\\n\\nIt is possible on every stage, but for sake of explanation we're going to use Battlefield since the timing is the easiest to explain. \\n\\nSay you are at ~12% and puff up throws you on the platform. At the apex, or slightly after, when you begin falling, you input a tech in case she does not do an up-air. This is because of how tech-trapping works. You essentially want to input the tech as soon as you are able to. Because of how early you input this tech, you are then able to SDI her up-air up in order to waste the rest of the frames in which you are tech trapped, and can then tech her up air as well. This means that there is no longer an easy missed tech for her to rest in this situation.\\n\\nPuff is not able to rest your SDI up until higher percents where you should just focus on DI’ing up-air properly anyway. In order to counter this puff has to read your tech with rest, or reaction tech-chase you with something else. This setup should no longer be a free 50-50. \\n\\n\\ngif:https://media.cookbook.gg/60f48566a9fa0602242693f5/64c0007576487479d1a9b576.mp4,https://media.cookbook.gg/60f48566a9fa0602242693f5/64c0007576487479d1a9b573.mp4\\n\\ngif:https://media.cookbook.gg/60f48566a9fa0602242693f5/64c0007576487479d1a9b574.mp4,https://media.cookbook.gg/60f48566a9fa0602242693f5/64c0007576487479d1a9b575.mp4\\n \",\"authors\":[],\"viewCount\":270}]},{\"id\":\"626968c0a013fb001680c3ec\",\"name\":\"sheik\",\"cookbook\":\"60f48566a9fa0602242693f5\",\"sections\":[{\"id\":\"64debdb66f8dd10a4002322c\",\"creationDate\":\"2023-08-18T00:39:18.000Z\",\"cookbook\":\"60f48566a9fa0602242693f5\",\"guide\":\"626968c0a013fb001680c3ec\",\"name\":\"neutral\",\"body\":\"## `Sfat`\\n\\n**Low %:**\\n* Drill shine → uptilt (14% knockdown, chain uptilts or techchase)\\n* Drill uptilt → uptilt\\n* Drill shine upsmash (16% launch, 27% on holding away) \\n* Drill shine → dtilt (20%)\\n* Drill shine → grab \\n* No DI, uptilt, sh uair\\n* Full DI, nair, wavedash back uptilt?, upsmash\\n* Could also read the jump with FH uair\\n* FH uair works at ~30%\\n \\n**Mid %:**\\n* Drill grab \\n* Drill uptilt (36%)\\n* Drill shine dtilt (~45%)\\n \\n**Kill conditions**\\n- Drill shine upsmash starting at around 100%\\n- dtilt upair ~80%\\n- drill uptilt uair ~60-70%\\n16% Usmash will launch, 27% on holding away\\n20% Dtilt knocks down\\n35% Hard bair\\n39% Hard nair\\n68% soft nair/bair\\n\\n## `Fiction`\\n\\n### The 1 and 3 mixup pattern\\n\\nThis is a basic mixup pattern that Fiction proposes for playing Fox against Sheik in neutral. You do not want to fight Sheik when you can’t do this.\\n\\nThe 1 and 3 come from counting/numbering how many times we dash dance before we attack. So a “1” is just running in and attacking. A “2” would be dashing away, then dashing in and attacking. A “3” would be dashing in, then dashing away, then dashing in and attacking. And so on. 3 is the most powerful against Sheik - almost everything you do should be a variation on the 3. \\n\\nWhen you do attack and dash in on Sheik, you have 4 options:\\n* Running shine\\n* Running nair\\n* Running grab\\n* Fullhop over -\u003e aerial\\n\\t\\nThere is nothing that Sheik can do to cover all 4 of these options. When you threaten her with one of these 4, she’s gonna get antsy, and she’ll probably do an ftilt or wavedash back - she has to do something to deal with it, but she can’t deal with all of them. \\n\\nThe big mistake many players make is that they want to dash in, dash out, and then react to what Sheik does. This is the wrong mentality. Always force the Sheik to react to your option. If you play against Sheik and say “I’m gonna bait them” and dash back and watch the Sheik, by the time you see the ftilt it’s too late to punish it - she is borderline impossible to punish on reaction. Sheik’s walling with ftilts and fairs is actually very vulnerable, but you can’t punish it on reaction. But Sheik has to do something to deal with this big mixup Fox has, and if she doesn’t she’s gonna get run over.\\n\\nThe 3 generally looks like a medium-length dash in (give Sheik something to react to) followed by a short dash back, then a dash in and instant attack. You don’t want to try to react. If Sheik throws out a move, the dash back will give you just enough timing mixup to beat her. Once they catch on a little and start to wait, the 1 starts to work really well. \\n\\t\\nBecause Sheik can’t cover everything, Fox ends up with a favorable mixup - anything Fox does Sheik can technically punish him for, but Fox has like 10 things that kill Sheik if they work, and she can only kill Fox is she guesses correctly which of those 10 things Fox is going to do.\\n\\nWhen Fiction plays a Sheik he just asks “Will I do a 1 or a 3? I’ll do a 1. What’ll I do after the 1? Running shine.” He doesn’t actually pay attention to the Sheik player. The more you pay attention the more you’ll try to react to what Sheik is doing, and the more you’ll lose. She’s the only character where it’s worse if you try to play neutral against her. You can’t say as Fox, “I’m gonna wait for you to make a mistake,” because that’s what Sheik wants. But Fox wants her to constantly feel like Fox is rolling the dice and throwing out a move - which you should, because that’s the hardest thing for her to deal with.\\n\\t\\nFiction calls dash in fullhop attack a “sneaky” 3 - you move in with the dash in, then you move out of Sheik’s threat range temporarily with the fullhop over her, then you try to hit her. It’s the same concept of Fox threatening and Sheik having to respond, then immediately punishing her after her response.\\n\\n### Clown Nairs, Not Dairs\\n\\n“Clown nairs” are basically just Fox nairs that are kind of just mindless rushdown nairs. It’s hard for Sheik to deal with Fox just jumping in with a nair, and Fox gets to clip her a lot of the time.\\n\\t\\nOn the flipside, Fox’s short hop dair in neutral is not as good against Sheik, because she’s kind of skinny, and will frequently pop out of the dair and grab Fox even without really good SDI. Drill tends to be better as a whiff punish, because the dair in neutral leads to Fox getting grabbed a lot of the time. Dair in neutral will mostly be limited to the fullhop portion of the mixup, where Fox can react to Sheik’s response and whiff punish her with the drill.\\n\\n### Updown Lasers\\n\\nIf Fox wants to start a match with lasers, he should do what Fiction calls updown lasers. This just means drop through the platform with a laser, then fullhop double laser back onto the platform, and repeat. This can be infuriating for Fox’s opponent, and is a good tool for Fox when he’s not feeling very aggro. He doesn’t want to react to Sheik, but can just avoid her entirely using platforms. Typically Fox wants to use these lasers to get Sheik to reach a point where 1 is unreactable, and at that point you have your 1 and 3 mixup pattern.\\n\\nThe only thing Sheik can do about this is standing needles, which requires a hard read. If Sheik commits to trying to needle Fox on the platform, Fox can just choose to run under her platform and upair her instead of continuing to laser.\\n\",\"authors\":[],\"viewCount\":509},{\"id\":\"64debdb66f8dd10a4002322d\",\"creationDate\":\"2023-08-18T00:39:18.000Z\",\"cookbook\":\"60f48566a9fa0602242693f5\",\"guide\":\"626968c0a013fb001680c3ec\",\"name\":\"defense\",\"body\":\"## `Fiction` Fox Defense\\n\\nFiction notes that if Sheik is spacing around Fox’s wake up shine and grabbing to punish the whiffed shine, it means they’re grabbing Fox late and giving him actionable frames. Wake up shine is an execution test, not a decisionmaking test. If they’re waiting for wake up shine, they’re not actually comboing you, they’re winning neutral on wake up. Fox can start doing mixups - you can spot dodge, roll, waveshine, drill, dash - you’re effectively playing neutral. You shouldn’t view grabbing the wakeup shine as the Sheik covering something, you should view it as a hole in their punish.\\n\\nIf you find yourself getting stuck in the corner, it’s very good to just go to ledge. Sheik just loses her corner pressure at that point because she can’t actually chase you to the ledge well. In those scary corner situations she’s just going to wait and try to react to you, but Fox can just go to ledge and ledge dash off and there’s nothing she can do. Or double jump laser land on the side platforms, what’s she going to do about it? Her pressure in the corner is an illusion.\\n\\nWhen Sheik dthrows Fox around 100%, Fox can DI full away and miss tech, then try to Amsah tech. Sheik can basically only dsmash, and Fox gets a 50/50 on late vs early dsmash. Because they’re trying to reaction tech chase you, they’ll probably do late dsmash. The only other thing they can do is early dsmash, but then you can start mixing in tech behind and live longer.\\n \",\"authors\":[],\"viewCount\":135},{\"id\":\"64debdb76f8dd10a4002322e\",\"creationDate\":\"2023-08-18T00:39:19.000Z\",\"cookbook\":\"60f48566a9fa0602242693f5\",\"guide\":\"626968c0a013fb001680c3ec\",\"name\":\"punish\",\"body\":\"## `Fiction` Punish\\nWhen Fox up throws Sheik to the platforms, he can cover tech in place with fullhop instant upair and react to the techroll after. If Fox upairs Sheik’s roll, she can slide off DI, so it’s often better to up air the tech in place and tech chase with grab or up tilt if Sheik doesn’t tech in place.\\n\\nOut of grab, Fox should always up throw upair. Sometimes they will SDI which might make Fox feel like he should bair, but you still should upair. It will work 90% of the time even against Sheiks that SDI, since there are still timing and spacing mixups Fox has. Sheik spamming jump will often get caught, and overall the outcomes from upair are much better for Fox than for Sheik.\\n \",\"authors\":[],\"viewCount\":186},{\"id\":\"64debdb76f8dd10a4002322f\",\"creationDate\":\"2023-08-18T00:39:19.000Z\",\"cookbook\":\"60f48566a9fa0602242693f5\",\"guide\":\"626968c0a013fb001680c3ec\",\"name\":\"stages\",\"body\":\"## `Fiction` Stages\\n\\nBattlefield is Sheik’s best stage, she will always take Fox to Battlefield. Avoid it if you can.\\n\\nFountain is good for Fox. You can slide off the dthrow mixups, slide off followup hits, dthrow tech chase to platforms and drift off platforms, and there’s not much she can do because of how low it is. It’s also a small stage, so she gets pressured really hard. The stage is overall good for Fox, Sheik will just get more backthrow gimps.\\n\\nDreamland is a good starter stage. Platforms are very frustrating for Sheik because they’re too high for her to up smash or up tilt through. She struggles to use them like she can on Stadium. It’s also annoying for her to kill Fox since Fox can DI to the platforms. It’s also a good starting stage because you’ll get a lot of time to gather information. You also have lots of space to drill into repeat waveshines, which can tilt Sheik a lot.\\n\\nFinal Destination is pretty broken for Fox. Some players have a more effective playstyle there though, like Duck, who plays a more grounded game with good neutral. That’s harder for Fox because he can’t fullhop to platforms, which limits Fox’s options. But against many Sheiks, FD is the best stage, arguably Fox’s best stage. Typically Fiction counterpicks FD first in a set rather than Stadium - if you lose on FD, you’re probably gonna lose the set.\\n\\nPokemon is Fox’s best stage, Fiction doesn’t spend a lot of time elaborating.\\n\\nYoshi’s is special, since you have to know the MU specifically on Yoshi’s. It’s great for Fox because he gets upair upair combos, wallride upb, very early kills off the top. He’s got the Moky (at 70% uthrow and if Sheik DIs to the side Fox can fullhop single hit fair up smash on a side platform to kill). However, Fox can’t do updown lasers and play the uninteractive game. On the flipside, the 1 and 3 mixup pattern is even stronger, because the entire stage is an unreactable mixup away.\\n \",\"authors\":[],\"viewCount\":122}]},{\"id\":\"626968d0a013fb001680c3ee\",\"name\":\"peach\",\"cookbook\":\"60f48566a9fa0602242693f5\",\"sections\":[{\"id\":\"64debdad6f8dd10a400231e7\",\"creationDate\":\"2023-08-18T00:39:09.000Z\",\"cookbook\":\"60f48566a9fa0602242693f5\",\"guide\":\"626968d0a013fb001680c3ee\",\"name\":\"neutral\",\"body\":\"vid:https://youtu.be/p4bAz1OLQ70\\n\\n## Peach Low percent\\n\\nIf in air about to jump: Short hop uair (as they rise!!!)\\nIf in air already can sometimes whiff punish with drill (mostly if they take space with the move)\\n\\nif spamming aerials low to ground, if:\\nNair: attack head or behind with bair (usually if she drifts in)\\nFair: Attack early with nair (if drift in)\\n\\nIf spamming side plat height float INSTANT fair drift in you can fullhop drill it (very niche)\\n\\n## Ground\\nPeach in corner/peach under side plat/fox in center: \\n\\ndrift back drill to bait a dash attack/grab\\nSH at them waveland back (ok), be ready to punish dash attacks by shielding/jumping/dashdance\\n\\nFh on side plat they are under, options are:\\n\\n## Go through plat drill (meh IMO)\\nsh off plat and go through plat/off side plat towards center and either dj or space bair\\nWalk off plat into grabbing their dash dance/shield (surprisingly very good)\\n\\nGo to top plat, go through/walk off plat/sh off plat and react carefully\\n\\nPeach in center/fox in corner:\\n\\n## Peach in air:\\nAbout to jump: Sh uair (not as good if you're in center but an \\\"ok\\\" option)\\n\\nIf they TAKE space in air with aerial:\\nDash under and take center (better vs fair)\\ndrill/grab (only if you're not dead in the corner)\\nroll (meh)\\nRun under bair (while they're mid air)\\nJump to side plat\\nIF YOU'RE SHIELDING IN THE CORNER AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO AN AERIAL ON YOUR SHIELD, PRIMARILY FAIR, WAVEDASH TOWARDS TURNAROUND UTILT IS AMAZING (THE LEFFEN)\\n\\nIf spamming float cancel low aerials, again you can bair their back if they're spamming them, but mostly for drift in\\n\\nIf they GIVE UP space in air with aerial:\\nDash dance closer\\nJump to side plat\\n(Mostly just a mixup after when you take space)\\n\\n## Ground:\\nDash fullhop fh drill/dash shine fh drill\\nJump to side plat (be careful for uair reads while you're jumping)\\nShield primarily if you think they're going to dash attack you and you don't have space to run away\\nIf cornered and Peach is playing grounded consider running shine drill\\n\\nPeach on plat (I'm looking at you Malachi):\\n\\nMostly about double jumping over them while maintaining center and bairing and sh uairing (be careful on yoshis as you can get dsmashed from being under side plat)\\n\\nPeach at higher percents:\\n\\nMain differences are:\\n\\nwhen you're in center you can start drift back nairing instead of drift back drill due to nair having more range\\nWhen peach is at midish percents and mid air you can start nairing her if you think she's going to remain in float for a while.

I will not take the position as one that will guide, but rather one that will inform as I personally am not a good enough player to be telling you what you should/shouldn't be doing in whatever match up. Inside this cookbook will be framedata, techniques, savestates, knowledge/data from puffs of all levels and personal opinion (that in majority of cases can most likely be disregarded).

If she guesses right, she gets a free low percent rest. If she guesses wrong it doesn’t matter as its very easy to react if you guessed wrong or not. There is a way to get rid of this 50-50 entirely, making it a very similar gimmick to Ice Climbers’ down-throw \u003e down-air.\\n\\nIt is possible on every stage, but for sake of explanation we're going to use Battlefield since the timing is the easiest to explain. \\n\\nSay you are at ~12% and puff up throws you on the platform. At the apex, or slightly after, when you begin falling, you input a tech in case she does not do an up-air. This is because of how tech-trapping works. You essentially want to input the tech as soon as you are able to. Because of how early you input this tech, you are then able to SDI her up-air up in order to waste the rest of the frames in which you are tech trapped, and can then tech her up air as well. This means that there is no longer an easy missed tech for her to rest in this situation.\\n\\nPuff is not able to rest your SDI up until higher percents where you should just focus on DI’ing up-air properly anyway. In order to counter this puff has to read your tech with rest, or reaction tech-chase you with something else.

You do not want to fight Sheik when you can’t do this.\\n\\nThe 1 and 3 come from counting/numbering how many times we dash dance before we attack. So a “1” is just running in and attacking. A “2” would be dashing away, then dashing in and attacking. A “3” would be dashing in, then dashing away, then dashing in and attacking. And so on. 3 is the most powerful against Sheik - almost everything you do should be a variation on the 3. \\n\\nWhen you do attack and dash in on Sheik, you have 4 options:\\n* Running shine\\n* Running nair\\n* Running grab\\n* Fullhop over -\u003e aerial\\n\\t\\nThere is nothing that Sheik can do to cover all 4 of these options. When you threaten her with one of these 4, she’s gonna get antsy, and she’ll probably do an ftilt or wavedash back - she has to do something to deal with it, but she can’t deal with all of them. \\n\\nThe big mistake many players make is that they want to dash in, dash out, and then react to what Sheik does. This is the wrong mentality. Always force the Sheik to react to your option. If you play against Sheik and say “I’m gonna bait them” and dash back and watch the Sheik, by the time you see the ftilt it’s too late to punish it - she is borderline impossible to punish on reaction. Sheik’s walling with ftilts and fairs is actually very vulnerable, but you can’t punish it on reaction. But Sheik has to do something to deal with this big mixup Fox has, and if she doesn’t she’s gonna get run over.\\n\\nThe 3 generally looks like a medium-length dash in (give Sheik something to react to) followed by a short dash back, then a dash in and instant attack. You don’t want to try to react. If Sheik throws out a move, the dash back will give you just enough timing mixup to beat her. Once they catch on a little and start to wait, the 1 starts to work really well. \\n\\t\\nBecause Sheik can’t cover everything, Fox ends up with a favorable mixup - anything Fox does Sheik can technically punish him for, but Fox has like 10 things that kill Sheik if they work, and she can only kill Fox is she guesses correctly which of those 10 things Fox is going to do.\\n\\nWhen Fiction plays a Sheik he just asks “Will I do a 1 or a 3? I’ll do a 1. What’ll I do after the 1? Running shine.” He doesn’t actually pay attention to the Sheik player. The more you pay attention the more you’ll try to react to what Sheik is doing, and the more you’ll lose. She’s the only character where it’s worse if you try to play neutral against her. You can’t say as Fox, “I’m gonna wait for you to make a mistake,” because that’s what Sheik wants. But Fox wants her to constantly feel like Fox is rolling the dice and throwing out a move - which you should, because that’s the hardest thing for her to deal with.\\n\\t\\nFiction calls dash in fullhop attack a “sneaky” 3 - you move in with the dash in, then you move out of Sheik’s threat range temporarily with the fullhop over her, then you try to hit her. It’s the same concept of Fox threatening and Sheik having to respond, then immediately punishing her after her response.\\n\\n### Clown Nairs, Not Dairs\\n\\n“Clown nairs” are basically just Fox nairs that are kind of just mindless rushdown nairs. It’s hard for Sheik to deal with Fox just jumping in with a nair, and Fox gets to clip her a lot of the time.\\n\\t\\nOn the flipside, Fox’s short hop dair in neutral is not as good against Sheik, because she’s kind of skinny, and will frequently pop out of the dair and grab Fox even without really good SDI. Drill tends to be better as a whiff punish, because the dair in neutral leads to Fox getting grabbed a lot of the time. Dair in neutral will mostly be limited to the fullhop portion of the mixup, where Fox can react to Sheik’s response and whiff punish her with the drill.\\n\\n### Updown Lasers\\n\\nIf Fox wants to start a match with lasers, he should do what Fiction calls updown lasers. This just means drop through the platform with a laser, then fullhop double laser back onto the platform, and repeat. This can be infuriating for Fox’s opponent, and is a good tool for Fox when he’s not feeling very aggro. He doesn’t want to react to Sheik, but can just avoid her entirely using platforms. Typically Fox wants to use these lasers to get Sheik to reach a point where 1 is unreactable, and at that point you have your 1 and 3 mixup pattern.\\n\\nThe only thing Sheik can do about this is standing needles, which requires a hard read. If Sheik commits to trying to needle Fox on the platform, Fox can just choose to run under her platform and upair her instead of continuing to laser.\\n\",\"authors\":[],\"viewCount\":509},{\"id\":\"64debdb66f8dd10a4002322d\",\"creationDate\":\"2023-08-18T00:39:18.000Z\",\"cookbook\":\"60f48566a9fa0602242693f5\",\"guide\":\"626968c0a013fb001680c3ec\",\"name\":\"defense\",\"body\":\"## `Fiction` Fox Defense\\n\\nFiction notes that if Sheik is spacing around Fox’s wake up shine and grabbing to punish the whiffed shine, it means they’re grabbing Fox late and giving him actionable frames. Wake up shine is an execution test, not a decisionmaking test. If they’re waiting for wake up shine, they’re not actually comboing you, they’re winning neutral on wake up. Fox can start doing mixups - you can spot dodge, roll, waveshine, drill, dash - you’re effectively playing neutral. You shouldn’t view grabbing the wakeup shine as the Sheik covering something, you should view it as a hole in their punish.\\n\\nIf you find yourself getting stuck in the corner, it’s very good to just go to ledge. Sheik just loses her corner pressure at that point because she can’t actually chase you to the ledge well. In those scary corner situations she’s just going to wait and try to react to you, but Fox can just go to ledge and ledge dash off and there’s nothing she can do. Or double jump laser land on the side platforms, what’s she going to do about it? Her pressure in the corner is an illusion.\\n\\nWhen Sheik dthrows Fox around 100%, Fox can DI full away and miss tech, then try to Amsah tech. Sheik can basically only dsmash, and Fox gets a 50/50 on late vs early dsmash. Because they’re trying to reaction tech chase you, they’ll probably do late dsmash. The only other thing they can do is early dsmash, but then you can start mixing in tech behind and live longer.\\n \",\"authors\":[],\"viewCount\":135},{\"id\":\"64debdb76f8dd10a4002322e\",\"creationDate\":\"2023-08-18T00:39:19.000Z\",\"cookbook\":\"60f48566a9fa0602242693f5\",\"guide\":\"626968c0a013fb001680c3ec\",\"name\":\"punish\",\"body\":\"## `Fiction` Punish\\nWhen Fox up throws Sheik to the platforms, he can cover tech in place with fullhop instant upair and react to the techroll after. If Fox upairs Sheik’s roll, she can slide off DI, so it’s often better to up air the tech in place and tech chase with grab or up tilt if Sheik doesn’t tech in place.\\n\\nOut of grab, Fox should always up throw upair. Sometimes they will SDI which might make Fox feel like he should bair, but you still should upair. It will work 90% of the time even against Sheiks that SDI, since there are still timing and spacing mixups Fox has. Sheik spamming jump will often get caught, and overall the outcomes from upair are much better for Fox than for Sheik.\\n \",\"authors\":[],\"viewCount\":186},{\"id\":\"64debdb76f8dd10a4002322f\",\"creationDate\":\"2023-08-18T00:39:19.000Z\",\"cookbook\":\"60f48566a9fa0602242693f5\",\"guide\":\"626968c0a013fb001680c3ec\",\"name\":\"stages\",\"body\":\"## `Fiction` Stages\\n\\nBattlefield is Sheik’s best stage, she will always take Fox to Battlefield. Avoid it if you can.\\n\\nFountain is good for Fox. You can slide off the dthrow mixups, slide off followup hits, dthrow tech chase to platforms and drift off platforms, and there’s not much she can do because of how low it is. It’s also a small stage, so she gets pressured really hard. The stage is overall good for Fox, Sheik will just get more backthrow gimps.\\n\\nDreamland is a good starter stage. Platforms are very frustrating for Sheik because they’re too high for her to up smash or up tilt through. She struggles to use them like she can on Stadium. It’s also annoying for her to kill Fox since Fox can DI to the platforms. It’s also a good starting stage because you’ll get a lot of time to gather information. You also have lots of space to drill into repeat waveshines, which can tilt Sheik a lot.\\n\\nFinal Destination is pretty broken for Fox. Some players have a more effective playstyle there though, like Duck, who plays a more grounded game with good neutral. That’s harder for Fox because he can’t fullhop to platforms, which limits Fox’s options. But against many Sheiks, FD is the best stage, arguably Fox’s best stage. Typically Fiction counterpicks FD first in a set rather than Stadium - if you lose on FD, you’re probably gonna lose the set.\\n\\nPokemon is Fox’s best stage, Fiction doesn’t spend a lot of time elaborating.\\n\\nYoshi’s is special, since you have to know the MU specifically on Yoshi’s. It’s great for Fox because he gets upair upair combos, wallride upb, very early kills off the top. He’s got the Moky (at 70% uthrow and if Sheik DIs to the side Fox can fullhop single hit fair up smash on a side platform to kill). However, Fox can’t do updown lasers and play the uninteractive game. On the flipside, the 1 and 3 mixup pattern is even stronger, because the entire stage is an unreactable mixup away.\\n \",\"authors\":[],\"viewCount\":122}]},{\"id\":\"626968d0a013fb001680c3ee\",\"name\":\"peach\",\"cookbook\":\"60f48566a9fa0602242693f5\",\"sections\":[{\"id\":\"64debdad6f8dd10a400231e7\",\"creationDate\":\"2023-08-18T00:39:09.000Z\",\"cookbook\":\"60f48566a9fa0602242693f5\",\"guide\":\"626968d0a013fb001680c3ee\",\"name\":\"neutral\",\"body\":\"vid:https://youtu.be/p4bAz1OLQ70\\n\\n## Peach Low percent\\n\\nIf in air about to jump: Short hop uair (as they rise!!!)\\nIf in air already can sometimes whiff punish with drill (mostly if they take space with the move)\\n\\nif spamming aerials low to ground, if:\\nNair: attack head or behind with bair (usually if she drifts in)\\nFair: Attack early with nair (if drift in)\\n\\nIf spamming side plat height float INSTANT fair drift in you can fullhop drill it (very niche)\\n\\n## Ground\\nPeach in corner/peach under side plat/fox in center: \\n\\ndrift back drill to bait a dash attack/grab\\nSH at them waveland back (ok), be ready to punish dash attacks by shielding/jumping/dashdance\\n\\nFh on side plat they are under, options are:\\n\\n## Go through plat drill (meh IMO)\\nsh off plat and go through plat/off side plat towards center and either dj or space bair\\nWalk off plat into grabbing their dash dance/shield (surprisingly very good)\\n\\nGo to top plat, go through/walk off plat/sh off plat and react carefully\\n\\nPeach in center/fox in corner:\\n\\n## Peach in air:\\nAbout to jump: Sh uair (not as good if you're in center but an \\\"ok\\\" option)\\n\\nIf they TAKE space in air with aerial:\\nDash under and take center (better vs fair)\\ndrill/grab (only if you're not dead in the corner)\\nroll (meh)\\nRun under bair (while they're mid air)\\nJump to side plat\\nIF YOU'RE SHIELDING IN THE CORNER AND THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO AN AERIAL ON YOUR SHIELD, PRIMARILY FAIR, WAVEDASH TOWARDS TURNAROUND UTILT IS AMAZING (THE LEFFEN)\\n\\nIf spamming float cancel low aerials, again you can bair their back if they're spamming them, but mostly for drift in\\n\\nIf they GIVE UP space in air with aerial:\\nDash dance closer\\nJump to side plat\\n(Mostly just a mixup after when you take space)\\n\\n## Ground:\\nDash fullhop fh drill/dash shine fh drill\\nJump to side plat (be careful for uair reads while you're jumping)\\nShield primarily if you think they're going to dash attack you and you don't have space to run away\\nIf cornered and Peach is playing grounded consider running shine drill\\n\\nPeach on plat (I'm looking at you Malachi):\\n\\nMostly about double jumping over them while maintaining center and bairing and sh uairing (be careful on yoshis as you can get dsmashed from being under side plat)\\n\\nPeach at higher percents:\\n\\nMain differences are:\\n\\nwhen you're in center you can start drift back nairing instead of drift back drill due to nair having more range\\nWhen peach is at midish percents and mid air you can start nairing her if you think she's going to remain in float for a while.
